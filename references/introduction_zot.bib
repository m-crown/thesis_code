It targets the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and offers nearly 10 million such sequences for reference. These are clustered into ∼2.4M species hypotheses (SHs), each assigned a unique digital object identifier (DOI) to promote unambiguous referencing across studies. UNITE users have contributed over 600 000 third-party sequence annotations, which are shared with a range of databases and other community resources. Recent improvements facilitate the detection of cross-kingdom biological associations and the integration of undescribed groups of organisms into everyday biological pursuits. Serving as a digital twin for eukaryotic biodiversity and communities worldwide, the latest release of UNITE offers improved avenues for biodiversity discovery, precise taxonomic communication and integration of biological knowledge across platforms.},

Several methods and procedures based on counts, their transformation and compositionality have been proposed in the literature to detect differentially abundant species in datasets containing hundreds to thousands of microbial species. Despite efforts to address the large numbers of zeros present in microbiome datasets, even after careful data preprocessing, the performance of existing methods is impaired by the presence of inflated zero counts and group-wise structured zeros (i.e. all zero counts in a group). We propose and validate using extensive simulations an approach combining two differential abundance testing methods, namely DESeq2-ZINBWaVE and DESeq2, to address the issues of zero-inflation and group-wise structured zeros, respectively. This combined approach was subsequently successfully applied to two plant microbiome datasets that revealed a number of taxa as interesting candidates for further experimental validation.},

The SCOP2 classification is described in terms of a directed acyclic graph in which nodes form a complex network of many-to-many relationships and are represented by a region of protein structure and sequence.

Indoor fungal communities and the distribution of potential allergens varied predictably across climate and geographical regions; where you live determines what fungi live with you inside your home. By contrast, bacterial communities in indoor dust were more strongly influenced by the number and types of occupants living in the homes.

Using electron microscopy, we examined specificities of polyclonal plasma Fabs, revealing recognition of both S1A and RBD epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike. Moreover, a 3.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a neutralizing monoclonal Fab-spike complex revealed an epitope that blocks ACE2 receptor binding.

This procedure involves two steps; firstly, we assign the binding of particular ligands to particular domains; secondly, we compare the chemical similarity of the PDB ligands to ligands in KEGG in order to assign cognate ligands. We find that use of the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers is necessary to enable efficient and accurate cognate ligand assignment. The PROCOGNATE database currently has cognate ligand mapping for 3277 (4118) protein structures and 351 (302) superfamilies, as described by the CATH and (SCOP) databases, respectively. We find that just under half of all ligands are only and always bound by a single domain, with 16\% bound by more than one domain and the remainder of the ligands showing a variety of binding modes. This finding has implications for domain recombination and the evolution of new protein functions. Domain architecture or context is also found to affect substrate specificity of particular domains, and we discuss example cases. The most popular PDB ligands are all found to be generic components of crystallisation buffers, highlighting the non-cognate ligand problem inherent in the PDB. In contrast, the most popular cognate ligands are all found to be universal cellular currencies of reducing power and energy such as NADH, FADH2 and ATP, respectively, reflecting the fact that the vast majority of enzymatic reactions utilise one of these popular co-factors. These ligands all share a common adenine ribonucleotide moiety, suggesting that many different domain superfamilies have converged to bind this chemical framework.},

The benefits include an unexpected variety of products that include chemicals, genes, metabolic pathways, structures, materials and behaviours. These may provide physical blueprints or inspiration for new designs. Criticism aimed at bioprospecting has been addressed, in part, by international treaties and legal agreements aimed at stopping biopiracy and many activities are now funded by agencies that require capacity-building and economic benefits in host countries. Thus, much contemporary bioprospecting has multiple goals, including the conservation of biodiversity, the sustainable management of natural resources and economic development. Ecologists are involved in three vital ways: first, applying ecological principles to the discovery of new resources. In this context, natural history becomes a vast economic database. Second, carrying out field studies, most of them demographic, to help regulate the harvest of wild species. Third, emphasizing the profound importance of millions of mostly microscopic species to the global economy.},

  abstract = {Analyzing the microbiome of diverse species and environments using next-generation sequencing techniques has significantly enhanced our understanding on metabolic, physiological and ecological roles of environmental microorganisms. However, the analysis of the microbiome is affected by experimental conditions (e.g. sequencing errors and genomic repeats) and computationally intensive and cumbersome downstream analysis (e.g. quality control, assembly, binning and statistical analyses). Moreover, the introduction of new sequencing technologies and protocols led to a flood of new methodologies, which also have an immediate effect on the results of the analyses. The aim of this work is to review the most important workflows for 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun and long-read metagenomics, as well as to provide best-practice protocols on experimental design, sample processing, sequencing, assembly, binning, annotation and visualization. To simplify and standardize the computational analysis, we provide a set of best-practice workflows for 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing data (available at https://github.com/grimmlab/MicrobiomeBestPracticeReview).},

In inflammatory bowel disease, a promising method of treatment is represented by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), FMT has shown its increasing effectiveness and safety in recent years for recurrent CDI; moreover, it showed real clinical benefits in treating SARS-CoV-2 and CDI co-infection. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are characterized by immune dysregulation, resulting in digestive tract damage caused by immune responses. Most current therapeutic strategies are associated with high costs and many adverse effects by directly targeting the immune response, so modifying the microbial environment by FMT offers an alternative approach that could indirectly influence the host's immune system in a safe way. Studies outline the endoscopic and clinical improvements in UC and CD in FMT patients versus control groups. This review outlines the multiple benefits of FMT in the case of IBD by improving patients unbalanced gut, therefore improving endoscopic and clinical symptomatology. We aim to emphasize the clinical importance and benefits of FMT in order to prevent flares or complications of IBD and to highlight that further validation is needed for establishing a clinical protocol for FMT in IBD.},

RESULTS: We present q2-feature-classifier ( https://github.com/qiime2/q2-feature-classifier ), a QIIME 2 plugin containing several novel machine-learning and alignment-based methods for taxonomy classification. We evaluated and optimized several commonly used classification methods implemented in QIIME 1 (RDP, BLAST, UCLUST, and SortMeRNA) and several new methods implemented in QIIME 2 (a scikit-learn naive Bayes machine-learning classifier, and alignment-based taxonomy consensus methods based on VSEARCH, and BLAST+) for classification of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker-gene amplicon sequence data. The naive-Bayes, BLAST+-based, and VSEARCH-based classifiers implemented in QIIME 2 meet or exceed the species-level accuracy of other commonly used methods designed for classification of marker gene sequences that were evaluated in this work. These evaluations, based on 19 mock communities and error-free sequence simulations, including classification of simulated “novel” marker-gene sequences, are available in our extensible benchmarking framework, tax-credit ( https://github.com/caporaso-lab/tax-credit-data ). CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the importance of parameter tuning for optimizing classifier performance, and we make recommendations regarding parameter choices for these classifiers under a range of standard operating conditions. q2-feature-classifier and tax-credit are both free, open-source, BSD-licensed packages available on GitHub.},

Detailed manual analysis on 618 of these, having at least one human relative, reveal extremely remote homologies and further unusual features. Only 25 novel superfamilies could be confirmed. Although most models map to existing superfamilies, AF2 domains expand CATH by 67\% and increases the number of unique 'global' folds by 36\% and will provide valuable insights on structure function relationships.

New methods control errors sufficiently such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs-including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward prediction-and of de novo OTUs-including accurate measurement of diversity and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases. We argue that the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that ASVs should replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker-gene analysis and reporting.},

Species-specific sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific investigations. No single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. We characterized V1-V8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora. Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions V1-V8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterium species and V3 among Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. The hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the “MEGALIGN” files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.},

To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth. RESULTS: The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 104 to 109 CFU/m2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria) and fungal (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46\% of intact/viable bacteria and 40\% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.},

While denoising methods have several inherent properties that make them desirable compared to clustering-based methods, questions remain as to the influence that these pipelines have on the ecological patterns being assessed, especially when compared to other methodological choices made when processing data (e.g. rarefaction) and computing diversity indices. We compared the respective influences of two widely used methods, namely DADA2 (a denoising method) vs. Mothur (a clustering method) on 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets (hypervariable region v4), and compared such effects to the rarefaction of the community table and OTU identity threshold (97\% vs. 99\%) on the ecological signals detected. We used a dataset comprising freshwater invertebrate (three Unionidae species) gut and environmental (sediment, seston) communities sampled in six rivers in the southeastern USA. We ranked the respective effects of each methodological choice on alpha and beta diversity, and taxonomic composition. The choice of the pipeline significantly influenced alpha and beta diversities and changed the ecological signal detected, especially on presence/absence indices such as the richness index and unweighted Unifrac. Interestingly, the discrepancy between OTU and ASV-based diversity metrics could be attenuated by the use of rarefaction. The identification of major classes and genera also revealed significant discrepancies across pipelines. Compared to the pipeline's effect, OTU threshold and rarefaction had a minimal impact on all measurements.},

The different steps in the bioinformatical analysis allow both the analysis of all samples combined and comparisons between samples. The bioinformatical analysis focuses on quality control of reads, merging of identical reads, and grouping of reads into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a threshold of 97\%. The threshold is inherited from the species threshold for classification of species based on 16S rRNA sequence comparison. The distribution of reads and OTUs within and between samples can be used to estimate α- and β-diversity, respectively. The relative occurrence of the taxonomic units at the levels of genus, family, order, class, and phylum can be compared between samples.

  abstract = {Summary: Microbiome studies increasingly associate geographical features like rurality and climate with microbiomes. It is essential to correctly integrate rich geographical metadata; and inconsistent definitions of rurality, can hinder cross-study comparisons. We address this with OMEinfo, a tool for automated retrieval of consistent geographical metadata from user-provided location data. OMEinfo leverages open data sources such as the Global Human Settlement Layer, and Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide. OMEinfo's web-app enables users to visualize and investigate the spatial distribution of metadata features. OMEinfo promotes reproducibility and consistency in microbiome metadata through a standardized metadata retrieval approach. To demonstrate utility, OMEinfo is used to replicate the results of a previous study linking population density to bacterial diversity. As the field explores relationships between microbiomes and geographical features, tools like OMEinfo will prove vital in developing a robust, accurate, and interconnected understanding of these interactions, whilst having applicability beyond this field to any studies utilizing location-based metadata. Finally, we release the OMEinfo annotation dataset of 5.3 million OMEinfo annotated samples from the ENA, for use in retrospective analyses of sequencing samples, and suggest several ways researchers and sequencing read repositories can improve the quality of underlying metadata submitted to these public stores. Availability and implementation: OMEinfo is freely available and released under an MIT licence.

As more and more microorganisms show a capacity for electron exchange, either to export or import them, it becomes obvious that DIET is a syntrophic metabolism that is much more present in nature than previously thought. This article reviews literature related to DIET, specifically in reference to anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic granular sludge, a biofilm, is a specialized microenvironment where syntrophic bacterial and archaeal organisms grow together in close proximity. Exoelectrogenic bacteria degrading organic substrates or intermediates need an electron sink and electrotrophic methanogens represent perfect partners to assimilate those electrons and produce methane. The granule extracellular polymeric substances by making the biofilm matrix more conductive, play a role as electrons carrier in DIET.},

Despite their ubiquity and abundance, we have a limited understanding of the microbial diversity found within homes and how the composition and diversity of microbial communities change across different locations within the home. Here we examined the diversity of bacterial communities found in nine distinct locations within each of forty homes in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, USA, using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We found that each of the sampled locations harbored bacterial communities that were distinct from one another with surfaces that are regularly cleaned typically harboring lower levels of diversity than surfaces that are cleaned infrequently. These location-specific differences in bacterial communities could be directly related to usage patterns and differences in the likely sources of bacteria dispersed onto these locations. Finally, we examined whether the variability across homes in bacterial diversity could be attributed to outdoor environmental factors, indoor habitat structure, or the occupants of the home. We found that the presence of dogs had a significant effect on bacterial community composition in multiple locations within homes as the homes occupied by dogs harbored more diverse communities and higher relative abundances of dog-associated bacterial taxa. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the types of bacteria deposited on surfaces outside the home and those found inside the home, highlighting that microbes from outside the home can have a direct effect on the microbial communities living on surfaces within our homes. Together this work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the microbial communities found in the home and the factors that shape the structure of these communities both within and between homes.},

We further describe the protein diversity that these models cover as an annotated interactive sequence similarity network, accessible at https://uniprot3d.org/atlas/AFDB90v4 . By searching for novelties from sequence, structure and semantic perspectives, we uncovered the β-flower fold, added several protein families to Pfam database2 and experimentally demonstrated that one of these belongs to a new superfamily of translation-targeting toxin-antitoxin systems, TumE-TumA. This work underscores the value of large-scale efforts in identifying, annotating and prioritizing new protein families.

In previous studies, markers of microbial exposure have been inversely related to these conditions. METHODS: In two cross-sectional studies, we compared children living on farms with those in a reference group with respect to the prevalence of asthma and atopy and to the diversity of microbial exposure. In one study–PARSIFAL (Prevention of Allergy-Risk Factors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle)–samples of mattress dust were screened for bacterial DNA with the use of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses to detect environmental bacteria that cannot be measured by means of culture techniques. In the other study–GABRIELA (Multidisciplinary Study to Identify the Genetic and Environmental Causes of Asthma in the European Community [GABRIEL] Advanced Study)–samples of settled dust from children's rooms were evaluated for bacterial and fungal taxa with the use of culture techniques. RESULTS: In both studies, children who lived on farms had lower prevalences of asthma and atopy and were exposed to a greater variety of environmental microorganisms than the children in the reference group. In turn, diversity of microbial exposure was inversely related to the risk of asthma (odds ratio for PARSIFAL, 0.62; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.89; odds ratio for GABRIELA, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.99). In addition, the presence of certain more circumscribed exposures was also inversely related to the risk of asthma; this included exposure to species in the fungal taxon eurotium (adjusted odds ratio, 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.18 to 0.76) and to a variety of bacterial species, including Listeria monocytogenes, bacillus species, corynebacterium species, and others (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.38 to 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Children living on farms were exposed to a wider range of microbes than were children in the reference group, and this exposure explains a substantial fraction of the inverse relation between asthma and growing up on a farm.

Based on a thorough analysis of the literature complemented by our quantitative characterisation and classification, we found that most of these molecules are constructed from nucleotide and amino-acid-type building blocks, as well as some recurring cofactor-specific chemical scaffolds. We show that, as expected, organic cofactors are on average significantly more polar and slightly larger than other metabolites in the cell, yet they cover the full spectrum of physicochemical properties found in the metabolome. Furthermore, we have identified intrinsic groupings among the cofactors, based on their molecular properties, structures and functions, that represent a new way of considering cofactors. Although some classes of cofactors, as defined by their physicochemical properties, exhibit clear structural communalities, cofactors with similar structures can have diverse functional and physicochemical profiles. Finally, we show that the molecular functions of the cofactors not only may duplicate reactions performed by inorganic metal cofactors and amino acids, the cell's other catalytic tools, but also provide novel chemistries for catalysis.},

The ASTRAL compendium provides several databases and tools to aid in the analysis of the protein structures classified in SCOP, particularly through the use of their sequences. SCOPe extends version 1.75 of the SCOP database, using automated curation methods to classify many structures released since SCOP 1.75. We have rigorously benchmarked our automated methods to ensure that they are as accurate as manual curation, though there are many proteins to which our methods cannot be applied.

To achieve the full microbial exploitation of lignocellulosic residues and the cost-effective production of bioproducts within a biorefinery, multiple metabolic pathways and enzymes of various specificities are required. In this work, highly diverse aerobic, mesophilic bacteria enriched from Keri Lake, a pristine marsh of increased biomass degradation and natural underground oil leaks, were explored for their metabolic versatility and enzymatic potential towards lignocellulosic substrates. A high number of Pseudomonas species, obtained from enrichment cultures where organosolv lignin served as the sole carbon and energy source, were able to assimilate a range of lignin-associated aromatic compounds. Comparatively more complex bacterial consortia, including members of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacilli, Sphingobacteria, and Flavobacteria, were also enriched from cultures with xylan or carboxymethyl cellulose as sole carbon sources. Numerous individual isolates could target diverse structural lignocellulose polysaccharides by expressing hydrolytic activities on crystalline or amorphous cellulose and xylan. Specific isolates showed increased potential for growth in lignin hydrolysates prepared from alkali pretreated agricultural wastes. The results suggest that Keri isolates represent a pool of effective lignocellulose degraders with significant potential for industrial applications in a lignocellulose biorefinery.},

The capacity for phytoremediation crops, such as Salix spp., to tolerate and even flourish in contaminated soils relies on a highly complex and predominantly cryptic interacting community of microbial life.

'Fish Creek' roots from trees pot grown in petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated or non-contaminated soil. All 189,849 assembled contigs were annotated without a priori assumption as to sequence origin and differential expression was assessed. RESULTS: The 839 contigs differentially expressed (DE) and annotated from S. purpurea revealed substantial increases in transcripts encoding abiotic stress response equipment, such as glutathione S-transferases, in roots of contaminated trees as well as the hallmarks of fungal interaction, such as SWEET2 (Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporter). A total of 8252 DE transcripts were fungal in origin, with contamination conditions resulting in a community shift from Ascomycota to Basidiomycota genera. In response to contamination, 1745 Basidiomycota transcripts increased in abundance (the majority uniquely expressed in contaminated soil) including major monosaccharide transporter MST1, primary cell wall and lamella CAZy enzymes, and an ectomycorrhiza-upregulated exo-β-1,3-glucanase (GH5). Additionally, 639 DE polycistronic transcripts from an uncharacterised Enterobacteriaceae species were uniformly in higher abundance in contamination conditions and comprised a wide spectrum of genes cryptic under laboratory conditions but considered putatively involved in eukaryotic interaction, biofilm formation and dioxygenase hydrocarbon degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal gene expression, representing the majority of contigs assembled, suggests out-competition of white rot Ascomycota genera (dominated by Pyronema), a sometimes ectomycorrhizal (ECM) Ascomycota (Tuber) and ECM Basidiomycota (Hebeloma) by a poorly characterised putative ECM Basidiomycota due to contamination. Root and fungal expression involved transcripts encoding carbohydrate/amino acid (C/N) dialogue whereas bacterial gene expression included the apparatus necessary for biofilm interaction and direct reduction of contamination stress, a potential bacterial currency for a role in tripartite mutualism. Unmistakable within the metatranscriptome is the degree to which the landscape of rhizospheric biology, particularly the important but predominantly uncharacterised fungal genetics, is yet to be discovered.},

  abstract = {Of the sequence comparison methods, profile-based methods perform with greater selectively than those that use pairwise comparisons. Of the profile methods, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are apparently the best. The first part of this paper describes calculations that (i) improve the performance of HMMs and (ii) determine a good procedure for creating HMMs for sequences of proteins of known structure. For a family of related proteins, more homologues are detected using multiple models built from diverse single seed sequences than from one model built from a good alignment of those sequences. A new procedure is described for detecting and correcting those errors that arise at the model-building stage of the procedure. These two improvements greatly increase selectivity and coverage. The second part of the paper describes the construction of a library of HMMs, called SUPERFAMILY, that represent essentially all proteins of known structure. The sequences of the domains in proteins of known structure, that have identities less than 95 \%, are used as seeds to build the models. Using the current data, this gives a library with 4894 models. The third part of the paper describes the use of the SUPERFAMILY model library to annotate the sequences of over 50 genomes. The models match twice as many target sequences as are matched by pairwise sequence comparison methods. For each genome, close to half of the sequences are matched in all or in part and, overall, the matches cover 35 \% of eukaryotic genomes and 45 \% of bacterial genomes. On average roughly 15\% of genome sequences are labelled as being hypothetical yet homologous to proteins of known structure. The annotations derived from these matches are available from a public web server at: http://stash.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY. This server also enables users to match their own sequences against the SUPERFAMILY model library.},

We look in particular at the possibility of convergent evolution, with a view to determining the extent to which the architectures observed in the genomes are due to functional necessity or evolutionary descent. We used domains of known structure, because from this and other information we know their evolutionary relationships. We use a range of methods including phylogenetic grouping, sequence similarity/alignment, mutation rates and comparative genomics to approach this difficult problem from several angles. RESULTS: Although we do not claim an exhaustive analysis, we conclude that between 0.4 and 4\% of sequences are involved in convergent evolution of domain architectures, and expect the actual number to be close to the lower bound. We also made two incidental observations, albeit on a small sample: the events leading to convergent evolution appear to be random with no functional or structural preferences, and changes in the number of tandem repeat domains occur more readily than changes which alter the domain composition. CONCLUSION: The principal conclusion is that the observed domain architectures of the sequences in the genomes are driven by evolutionary descent rather than functional necessity.

Such methods facilitate structural comparisons and provide a greater understanding of structure and function. The most widely used and comprehensive databases are SCOP, CATH and FSSP, which represent three unique methods of classifying protein structures: purely manual, a combination of manual and automated, and purely automated, respectively. In order to develop reliable template libraries and benchmarks for protein-fold recognition, a systematic comparison of these databases has been carried out to determine their overall agreement in classifying protein structures. RESULTS: Approximately two-thirds of the protein chains in each database are common to all three databases. Despite employing different methods, and basing their systems on different rules of protein structure and taxonomy, SCOP, CATH and FSSP agree on the majority of their classifications. Discrepancies and inconsistencies are accounted for by a small number of explanations. Other interesting features have been identified, and various differences between manual and automatic classification methods are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Using these databases requires an understanding of the rules upon which they are based; each method offers certain advantages depending on the biological requirements and knowledge of the user. The degree of discrepancy between the systems also has an impact on reliability of prediction methods that employ these schemes as benchmarks. To generate accurate fold templates for threading, we extract information from a consensus database, encompassing agreements between SCOP, CATH and FSSP.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metatranscriptomics is emerging as a powerful technology for the functional characterization of complex microbial communities (microbiomes). Use of unbiased RNA-sequencing can reveal both the taxonomic composition and active biochemical functions of a complex microbial community. However, the lack of established reference genomes, computational tools and pipelines make analysis and interpretation of these datasets challenging. Systematic studies that compare data across microbiomes are needed to demonstrate the ability of such pipelines to deliver biologically meaningful insights on microbiome function. RESULTS: Here, we apply a standardized analytical pipeline to perform a comparative analysis of metatranscriptomic data from diverse microbial communities derived from mouse large intestine, cow rumen, kimchi culture, deep-sea thermal vent and permafrost. Sequence similarity searches allowed annotation of 19 to 76\% of putative messenger RNA (mRNA) reads, with the highest frequency in the kimchi dataset due to its relatively low complexity and availability of closely related reference genomes. Metatranscriptomic datasets exhibited distinct taxonomic and functional signatures. From a metabolic perspective, we identified a common core of enzymes involved in amino acid, energy and nucleotide metabolism and also identified microbiome-specific pathways such as phosphonate metabolism (deep sea) and glycan degradation pathways (cow rumen). Integrating taxonomic and functional annotations within a novel visualization framework revealed the contribution of different taxa to metabolic pathways, allowing the identification of taxa that contribute unique functions. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a single, standard pipeline confirms that the rich taxonomic and functional diversity observed across microbiomes is not simply an artefact of different analysis pipelines but instead reflects distinct environmental influences. At the same time, our findings show how microbiome complexity and availability of reference genomes can impact comprehensive annotation of metatranscriptomes. Consequently, beyond the application of standardized pipelines, additional caution must be taken when interpreting their output and performing downstream, microbiome-specific, analyses.

Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

The protective microbiota had a low abundance of Streptococcaceae relative to outdoor-associated bacterial taxa. The protective effect was independent of richness and total bacterial load and was associated with reduced proinflammatory cytokine responses against bacterial cell wall components ex vivo. We were able to reproduce these findings in a study among rural German children2 and showed that children living in German non-farm homes with an indoor microbiota more similar to Finnish farm homes have decreased asthma risk. The indoor dust microbiota composition appears to be a definable, reproducible predictor of asthma risk and a potential modifiable target for asthma prevention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differential expression analysis on the basis of RNA-Seq count data has become a standard tool in transcriptomics. Several studies have shown that prior normalization of the data is crucial for a reliable detection of transcriptional differences. Until now it has not been clear whether and how the transcriptomic approach can be used for differential expression analysis in metatranscriptomics. METHODS: We propose a model for differential expression in metatranscriptomics that explicitly accounts for variations in the taxonomic composition of transcripts across different samples. As a main consequence the correct normalization of metatranscriptomic count data under this model requires the taxonomic separation of the data into organism-specific bins. Then the taxon-specific scaling of organism profiles yields a valid normalization and allows us to recombine the scaled profiles into a metatranscriptomic count matrix. This matrix can then be analyzed with statistical tools for transcriptomic count data. For taxon-specific scaling and recombination of scaled counts we provide a simple R script. RESULTS: When applying transcriptomic tools for differential expression analysis directly to metatranscriptomic data with an organism-independent (global) scaling of counts the resulting differences may be difficult to interpret. The differences may correspond to changing functional profiles of the contributing organisms but may also result from a variation of taxonomic abundances. Taxon-specific scaling eliminates this variation and therefore the resulting differences actually reflect a different behavior of organisms under changing conditions. In simulation studies we show that the divergence between results from global and taxon-specific scaling can be drastic. In particular, the variation of organism abundances can imply a considerable increase of significant differences with global scaling. Also, on real metatranscriptomic data, the predictions from taxon-specific and global scaling can differ widely. Our studies indicate that in real data applications performed with global scaling it might be impossible to distinguish between differential expression in terms of transcriptomic changes and differential composition in terms of changing taxonomic proportions. CONCLUSIONS: As in transcriptomics, a proper normalization of count data is also essential for differential expression analysis in metatranscriptomics. Our model implies a taxon-specific scaling of counts for normalization of the data. The application of taxon-specific scaling consequently removes taxonomic composition variations from functional profiles and therefore provides a clear interpretation of the observed functional differences.},

Ten rounds of model building and 123 cycles of restrained reciprocal space refinement have resulted in a model containing 94.4\% of the theoretical atoms of the protein-inhibitor complex with an R-factor of 0.231. The fit of the model to the density is excellent, except for occasional side-chains and two sections of the regulatory chains that may be disordered. The electron density for the PALA molecule is readily identifiable for both catalytic (c) chains of the asymmetric unit and bonding interactions with several important residues including Ser52, Arg54, Thr55, Ser80, Lys84, Arg105, His134, Arg165, Arg229 and Gln231 are apparent. The carboxylate groups of the PALA molecule are in a nearly cis conformation. Gross quaternary changes between the T and R forms are noted and in agreement with earlier work from this laboratory. Namely, in the new structure the catalytic trimers move apart by 12 A along the 3-fold axis of the enzyme and relocate by 10 degrees relative to each other, adopting a more eclipsed position. The regulatory (r) chains in the new structure reorient about their 2-fold axis by 15 degrees. Large tertiary changes that include domain migration and rearrangement are also present between these two forms. In the R form both domains of the catalytic chain relocate closer to each other in order to bind to the inhibitor. The polar domain seems to bind primarily to the carbamoyl phosphate moiety of PALA, and the equatorial domain binds primarily to the L-aspartate moiety. Other changes in tertiary structure bring the 80s loop (from an adjacent catalytic chain) and the 240s loop into a position to interact with the PALA molecule. Changes have been searched for in all interface regions of the enzyme. While the C1-C4 and C1-R4 regions have been completely altered, most of the other interchain interfaces are similar in the T and R forms. The intrachain interfaces, between domains of the same catalytic chains, have undergone some reorganization as these domains move closer to each other when the inhibitor is bound. This new structure allows a reinterpretation of genetic and chemical modification studies done to date.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Core components are rigorous blind testing of methods and evaluation of the results by independent assessors. In the most recent experiment (CASP14), deep-learning methods from one research group consistently delivered computed structures rivaling the corresponding experimental ones in accuracy. In this sense, the results represent a solution to the classical protein-folding problem, at least for single proteins. The models have already been shown to be capable of providing solutions for problematic crystal structures, and there are broad implications for the rest of structural biology. Other research groups also substantially improved performance. Here, we describe these results and outline some of the many implications. Other related areas of CASP, including modeling of protein complexes, structure refinement, estimation of model accuracy, and prediction of inter-residue contacts and distances, are also described.},

Using 16S information, PICRUSt recaptures key findings from the Human Microbiome Project and accurately predicts the abundance of gene families in host-associated and environmental communities, with quantifiable uncertainty.

Various human activities are responsible for significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including data centers and other sources of large-scale computation. Although many important scientific milestones are achieved thanks to the development of high-performance computing, the resultant environmental impact is underappreciated. In this work, a methodological framework to estimate the carbon footprint of any computational task in a standardized and reliable way is presented and metrics to contextualize GHG emissions are defined. A freely available online tool, Green Algorithms (www.green-algorithms.org) is developed, which enables a user to estimate and report the carbon footprint of their computation. The tool easily integrates with computational processes as it requires minimal information and does not interfere with existing code, while also accounting for a broad range of hardware configurations. Finally, the GHG emissions of algorithms used for particle physics simulations, weather forecasts, and natural language processing are quantified. Taken together, this study develops a simple generalizable framework and freely available tool to quantify the carbon footprint of nearly any computation. Combined with recommendations to minimize unnecessary CO2 emissions, the authors hope to raise awareness and facilitate greener computation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The public transit is a built environment with high occupant density across the globe, and identifying factors shaping public transit air microbiomes will help design strategies to minimize the transmission of pathogens. However, the majority of microbiome works dedicated to the public transit air are limited to amplicon sequencing, and our knowledge regarding the functional potentials and the repertoire of resistance genes (i.e. resistome) is limited. Furthermore, current air microbiome investigations on public transit systems are focused on single cities, and a multi-city assessment of the public transit air microbiome will allow a greater understanding of whether and how broad environmental, building, and anthropogenic factors shape the public transit air microbiome in an international scale. Therefore, in this study, the public transit air microbiomes and resistomes of six cities across three continents (Denver, Hong Kong, London, New York City, Oslo, Stockholm) were characterized. RESULTS: City was the sole factor associated with public transit air microbiome differences, with diverse taxa identified as drivers for geography-associated functional potentials, concomitant with geographical differences in species- and strain-level inferred growth profiles. Related bacterial strains differed among cities in genes encoding resistance, transposase, and other functions. Sourcetracking estimated that human skin, soil, and wastewater were major presumptive resistome sources of public transit air, and adjacent public transit surfaces may also be considered presumptive sources. Large proportions of detected resistance genes were co-located with mobile genetic elements including plasmids. Biosynthetic gene clusters and city-unique coding sequences were found in the metagenome-assembled genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, geographical specificity transcends multiple aspects of the public transit air microbiome, and future efforts on a global scale are warranted to increase our understanding of factors shaping the microbiome of this unique built environment.},

The absolute abundance data are modeled using a linear regression framework. This formulation makes a fundamental advancement in the field because, unlike the existing methods, it (a) provides statistically valid test with appropriate p-values, (b) provides confidence intervals for differential abundance of each taxon, (c) controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR), (d) maintains adequate power, and (e) is computationally simple to implement.},

  abstract = {Enzymes catalyze a particular reaction in cells, but only a few control the rate of this reaction and the metabolic pathway that follows. One specific mechanism for such enzymatic control of a metabolic pathway involves molecular feedback, whereby a metabolite further down the pathway acts at a unique site on the control enzyme to alter its activity allosterically. This regulation may be positive or negative (or both), depending upon the particular system. Another method of enzymatic control involves the cooperative binding of the substrate, which allows a large change in enzyme activity to emanate from only a small change in substrate concentration. Allosteric regulation and homotropic cooperativity are often known to involve significant conformational changes in the structure of the protein. Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) is the textbook example of an enzyme that regulates a metabolic pathway, namely, pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, by feedback control and by the cooperative binding of the substrate, L-aspartate. The catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of this enzyme have been extensively studied. A series of X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme in the presence and absence of substrates, products, and analogues have provided details, at the molecular level, of the conformational changes that the enzyme undergoes as it shifts between its low-activity, low-affinity form (T state) to its high-activity, high-affinity form (R state). These structural data provide insights into not only how this enzyme catalyzes the reaction between l-aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate, but also how the allosteric effectors modulate this activity. In this Account, we summarize studies on the structure of the enzyme and describe how these structural data provide insights into the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the enzyme. The ATCase-catalyzed reaction is regulated by nucleotide binding some 60 Å from the active site, inducing structural alterations that modulate catalytic activity. The delineation of the structure and function in this particular model system will help in understanding the molecular basis of cooperativity and allosteric regulation in other systems as well.},

For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether.

To increase the active site annotations in the Pfam database, we have developed a strict set of rules, chosen to reduce the rate of false positives, which enable the transfer of experimentally determined active site residue data to other sequences within the same Pfam family. DESCRIPTION: We have created a large database of predicted active site residues. On comparing our active site predictions to those found in UniProtKB, Catalytic Site Atlas, PROSITE and MEROPS we find that we make many novel predictions. On investigating the small subset of predictions made by these databases that are not predicted by us, we found these sequences did not meet our strict criteria for prediction. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of our methodology and estimate that only 3\% of our predicted sequences are false positives. CONCLUSION: We have predicted 606110 active site residues, of which 94\% are not found in UniProtKB, and have increased the active site annotations in Pfam by more than 200 fold. Although implemented for Pfam, the tool we have developed for transferring the data can be applied to any alignment with associated experimental active site data and is available for download.

The resulting models contain approximately the same number of atomic overlaps as experimentally determined crystal structures and maintain good stereochemistry.

It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

However, inconsistent findings across studies impede a comprehensive understanding of their roles in IBD and their potential as reliable diagnostic biomarkers. To address this challenge, here we comprehensively analyze 9 metagenomic and 4 metabolomics cohorts of IBD from different populations. Through cross-cohort integrative analysis (CCIA), we identify a consistent characteristic of commensal gut microbiota. Especially, three bacteria, namely Asaccharobacter celatus, Gemmiger formicilis, and Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum, which are rarely reported in IBD. Metagenomic functional analysis reveals that essential gene of Two-component system pathway, linked to fecal calprotectin, are implicated in IBD. Metabolomics analysis shows 36 identified metabolites with significant differences, while the roles of these metabolites in IBD are still unknown. To further elucidate the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolites, we construct multi-omics biological correlation (MOBC) maps, which highlights gut microbial biotransformation deficiencies and significant alterations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Finally, we identify multi-omics biomarkers for IBD diagnosis, validated across multiple global cohorts (AUROC values ranging from 0.92 to 0.98). Our results offer valuable insights and a significant resource for developing mechanistic hypotheses on host-microbiome interactions in IBD.},

Several computational methods exist for analyzing 16S amplicon sequencing. However, the most-used bioinformatics tools cannot produce high quality genus-level or species-level taxonomic calls and may underestimate the potential accuracy of these calls. We used 16S sequencing data from mock bacterial communities to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of several bioinformatics pipelines and genomic reference libraries used for microbiome analyses, concentrating on measuring the accuracy of species-level taxonomic assignments of 16S amplicon reads. We evaluated the tools DADA2, QIIME 2, Mothur, PathoScope 2, and Kraken 2 in conjunction with reference libraries from Greengenes, SILVA, Kraken 2, and RefSeq. Profiling tools were compared using publicly available mock community data from several sources, comprising 136 samples with varied species richness and evenness, several different amplified regions within the 16S rRNA gene, and both DNA spike-ins and cDNA from collections of plated cells. PathoScope 2 and Kraken 2, both tools designed for whole-genome metagenomics, outperformed DADA2, QIIME 2 using the DADA2 plugin, and Mothur, which are theoretically specialized for 16S analyses. Evaluations of reference libraries identified the SILVA and RefSeq/Kraken 2 Standard libraries as superior in accuracy compared to Greengenes. These findings support PathoScope and Kraken 2 as fully capable, competitive options for genus- and species-level 16S amplicon sequencing data analysis, whole genome sequencing, and metagenomics data tools.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein evolution gives rise to families of structurally related proteins, within which sequence identities can be extremely low. As a result, structure-based classifications can be effective at identifying unanticipated relationships in known structures and in optimal cases function can also be assigned. The ever increasing number of known protein structures is too large to classify all proteins manually, therefore, automatic methods are needed for fast evaluation of protein structures. RESULTS: We present a semi-automatic procedure for deriving a novel hierarchical classification of protein domain structures (CATH). The four main levels of our classification are protein class (C), architecture (A), topology (T) and homologous superfamily (H). Class is the simplest level, and it essentially describes the secondary structure composition of each domain. In contrast, architecture summarises the shape revealed by the orientations of the secondary structure units, such as barrels and sandwiches. At the topology level, sequential connectivity is considered, such that members of the same architecture might have quite different topologies. When structures belonging to the same T-level have suitably high similarities combined with similar functions, the proteins are assumed to be evolutionarily related and put into the same homologous superfamily. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the structural families generated by CATH reveals the prominent features of protein structure space. We find that nearly a third of the homologous superfamilies (H-levels) belong to ten major T-levels, which we call superfolds, and furthermore that nearly two-thirds of these H-levels cluster into nine simple architectures. A database of well-characterised protein structure families, such as CATH, will facilitate the assignment of structure-function/evolution relationships to both known and newly determined protein structures.},

The highlight was the human assisted prediction of T0806, a large and topologically complex target with no homologs of known structure, which had unprecedented accuracy-¡3.0 Å root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the crystal structure over 223 residues. For this target, we increased the amount of conformational sampling over our fully automated method by employing an iterative hybridization protocol.

By developing the capacity to harness the advantages provided by the newest technologies, investigators can “scale up” by increasing the number of samples and replicates processed, the frequency of sampling over time and space, and even the depth of sampling such as by sequencing more reads per sample or more markers per sample. The ability to scale up is made possible by the reduced hands-on time and cost per sample provided by the newest kits, platforms and software tools. Results gleaned from broad-scale monitoring will provide opportunities to address key scientific questions linked to biodiversity and its dynamics across time and space as well as being more relevant for policymakers, enabling science-based decision-making, and provide a greater socio-economic impact.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) is the major pathogen that causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). With the availability of large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) measurements, comparative network analysis can provide a promising way to study the host-virus interactions and their functional significance in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Until now, there have been a large number of HIV studies based on various animal models. In this paper, we present a novel framework for studying the host-HIV interactions through comparative network analysis across different species. RESULTS: Based on the proposed framework, we test our hypothesis that HIV-1 attacks essential biological pathways that are conserved across species. We selected the Homo sapiens and Mus musculus PPI networks with the largest coverage among the PPI networks that are available from public databases. By using a local network alignment algorithm based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), we first identified the pathways that are conserved in both networks. Next, we analyzed the HIV-1 susceptibility of these pathways, in comparison with random pathways in the human PPI network. Our analysis shows that the conserved pathways have a significantly higher probability of being intercepted by HIV-1. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis shows that most of the enriched GO terms are related to signal transduction, which has been conjectured to be one of the major mechanisms targeted by HIV-1 for the takeover of the host cell. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study clearly shows that the comparative analysis of PPI networks across different species can provide important insights into the host-HIV interactions and the detailed mechanisms of HIV-1. We expect that comparative multiple network analysis of various species that have different levels of susceptibility to similar lentiviruses may provide a very effective framework for generating novel, and experimentally verifiable hypotheses on the mechanisms of HIV-1. We believe that the proposed framework has the potential to expedite the elucidation of the important mechanisms of HIV-1, and ultimately, the discovery of novel anti-HIV drugs.},

Evidence from field studies indicates that many of the uncultivated phyla are found in diverse habitats, and some are extraordinarily abundant.

  abstract = {We present CATHEDRAL, an iterative protocol for determining the location of previously observed protein folds in novel multidomain protein structures. CATHEDRAL builds on the features of a fast secondary-structure-based method (using graph theory) to locate known folds within a multidomain context and a residue-based, double-dynamic programming algorithm, which is used to align members of the target fold groups against the query protein structure to identify the closest relative and assign domain boundaries. To increase the fidelity of the assignments, a support vector machine is used to provide an optimal scoring scheme. Once a domain is verified, it is excised, and the search protocol is repeated in an iterative fashion until all recognisable domains have been identified. We have performed an initial benchmark of CATHEDRAL against other publicly available structure comparison methods using a consensus dataset of domains derived from the CATH and SCOP domain classifications. CATHEDRAL shows superior performance in fold recognition and alignment accuracy when compared with many equivalent methods. If a novel multidomain structure contains a known fold, CATHEDRAL will locate it in 90\% of cases, with ¡1\% false positives. For nearly 80\% of assigned domains in a manually validated test set, the boundaries were correctly delineated within a tolerance of ten residues. For the remaining cases, previously classified domains were very remotely related to the query chain so that embellishments to the core of the fold caused significant differences in domain sizes and manual refinement of the boundaries was necessary. To put this performance in context, a well-established sequence method based on hidden Markov models was only able to detect 65\% of domains, with 33\% of the subsequent boundaries assigned within ten residues. Since, on average, 50\% of newly determined protein structures contain more than one domain unit, and typically 90\% or more of these domains are already classified in CATH, CATHEDRAL will considerably facilitate the automation of protein structure classification.},

  abstract = {Nearly every function in living beings depends on proteins. They account for 50\% of the dry mass of cells and play a role in everything an organism does. There are many different types of proteins. Different proteins can play a role in speeding up chemical reactions, storage, defense, cell communication, movement, and structural support. Humans have tens of thousands of proteins in their bodies at any moment. Each of these proteins has its structure and function. They are known as the most structurally complicated biological molecules. As diverse as they can be, they are all made up of the same 20 amino acids. Large polypeptide chains can be created by forming peptide bonds between the amino and carboxyl groups on 2 different amino acids. Every protein can be described according to its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. In brief, the primary structure is the linear chain of amino acids. The secondary structure comprises regions stabilized by hydrogen bonds between atoms in the polypeptide backbone. Tertiary structure is the protein's 3-dimensional shape determined by regions stabilized by interactions between the side chains. Quaternary structure is the association between 2 or more polypeptides, but not every protein has a quaternary structure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical databases normally contain large amounts of data in a variety of forms. Although they grant significant insights into diagnosis and treatment, implementing data exploration into current medical databases is challenging since these are often based on a relational schema and cannot be used to easily extract information for cohort analysis and visualization. As a consequence, valuable information regarding cohort distribution or patient similarity may be missed. With the rapid advancement of biomedical technologies, new forms of data from methods such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or chromosome microarray (array CGH) are constantly being generated; hence it can be expected that the amount and complexity of medical data will rise and bring relational database systems to a limit. DESCRIPTION: We present Graph4Med, a web application that relies on a graph database obtained by transforming a relational database. Graph4Med provides a straightforward visualization and analysis of a selected patient cohort. Our use case is a database of pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Along routine patients' health records it also contains results of latest technologies such as NGS data. We developed a suitable graph data schema to convert the relational data into a graph data structure and store it in Neo4j. We used NeoDash to build a dashboard for querying and displaying patients' cohort analysis. This way our tool (1) quickly displays the overview of patients' cohort information such as distributions of gender, age, mutations (fusions), diagnosis; (2) provides mutation (fusion) based similarity search and display in a maneuverable graph; (3) generates an interactive graph of any selected patient and facilitates the identification of interesting patterns among patients. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a graph database for storing and querying medical databases. Our dashboard allows a fast and interactive analysis and visualization of complex medical data. It is especially useful for patients similarity search based on mutations (fusions), of which vast amounts of data have been generated by NGS in recent years. It can discover relationships and patterns in patients cohorts that are normally hard to grasp. Expanding Graph4Med to more medical databases will bring novel insights into diagnostic and research.},

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is central to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, a group of diseases in which arteries become occluded with atheromas that may rupture, leading to different cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. There is a large body of epidemiologic and animal model evidence associating periodontitis with atherosclerotic disease, and many potential mechanisms linking these diseases have been elucidated. This chapter will update knowledge on these mechanisms, which generally fall into 2 categories: microbial invasion and infection of atheromas; and inflammatory and immunologic. With respect to the invasion and infection of atheromas, it is well established that organisms from the subgingival biofilm can enter the circulation and lodge in most distant tissues. Bacteremias resulting from oral interventions, and even oral hygiene activities, are well documented. More recently, indirect routes of entry of oral organisms (via phagocytes or dendritic cells) have been described for many oral organisms, into many tissues. Such organisms include the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Intracellular survival of these organisms with dissemination to distant sites (The Trojan Horse approach) has been described. Their relative contribution to atheroma formation and progression has been studied mainly in experimental research, with results demonstrating that these organisms can invade endothelial cells and phagocytic cells within the atheroma, leading to pathogenic changes and progression of the atheroma lesion. The second category of mechanisms potentially linking periodontitis to atherosclerosis includes the dumping of inflammatory mediators originating from periodontal lesions into the systemic circulation. These inflammatory mediators, such as C-reactive protein, matrix metalloproteinases, fibrinogen, and other hemostatic factors, would further accelerate atheroma formation and progression, mainly through oxidative stress and inflammatory dysfunction. Moreover, direct effects on lipid oxidation have also been described. In summary, the evidence supports the concept that periodontitis enhances the levels of systemic mediators of inflammation that are risk factors for atherosclerotic diseases.},

Confusion over the distinction between the definitions of rarefying and rarefaction continues to cloud the interpretation of their results. More importantly, the authors made a variety of problematic choices when designing and analyzing their simulations. I identified 11 factors that could have compromised the results of the original study. I reproduced the original simulation results and assessed the impact of those factors on the underlying conclusion that rarefying data is inadmissible. Throughout, the design of the original study made choices that caused rarefying and rarefaction to appear to perform worse than they truly did. Most important were the approaches used to assess ecological distances, the removal of samples with low sequencing depth, and not accounting for conditions where sequencing effort is confounded with treatment group. Although the original study criticized rarefying for the arbitrary removal of valid data, repeatedly rarefying data many times (i.e., rarefaction) incorporates all the data. In contrast, it is the removal of rare taxa that would appear to remove valid data. Overall, I show that rarefaction is the most robust approach to control for uneven sequencing effort when considered across a variety of alpha and beta diversity metrics.IMPORTANCEOver the past 10 years, the best method for normalizing the sequencing depth of samples characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been contentious. An often cited article by McMurdie and Holmes forcefully argued that rarefying the number of sequence counts was “inadmissible” and should not be employed. However, I identified a number of problems with the design of their simulations and analysis that compromised their results. In fact, when I reproduced and expanded upon their analysis, it was clear that rarefaction was actually the most robust approach for controlling for uneven sequencing effort across samples. Rarefaction limits the rate of falsely detecting and rejecting differences between treatment groups. Far from being “inadmissible”, rarefaction is a valuable tool for analyzing microbiome sequence data.},

  abstract = {Six DNA regions were evaluated as potential DNA barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

Herein we present a database based on hidden Markov model profiles (HMMs), which combines high quality and completeness. Our database, Pfam, consists of parts A and B. Pfam-A is curated and contains well-characterized protein domain families with high quality alignments, which are maintained by using manually checked seed alignments and HMMs to find and align all members. Pfam-B contains sequence families that were generated automatically by applying the Domainer algorithm to cluster and align the remaining protein sequences after removal of Pfam-A domains. By using Pfam, a large number of previously unannotated proteins from the Caenorhabditis elegans genome project were classified. We have also identified many novel family memberships in known proteins, including new kazal, Fibronectin type III, and response regulator receiver domains. Pfam-A families have permanent accession numbers and form a library of HMMs available for searching and automatic annotation of new protein sequences.},

A central and persistent challenge facing protein structural analysis is the discrimination between homology and convergence for structurally similar domains that lack significant sequence similarity. Classic examples are the OB-fold and SH3 domains, both small, modular beta-barrel protein superfolds. The similarities among these domains have variously been attributed to common descent or to convergent evolution. Using a sequence profile-based phylogenetic technique, we analyzed all structurally characterized OB-fold, SH3, and PDZ domains with less than 40\% mutual sequence identity. An all-against-all, profile-versus-profile analysis of these domains revealed many previously undetectable significant interrelationships. The matrices of scores were used to infer phylogenies based on our derivation of the relationships between sequence similarity E-values and evolutionary distances. The resulting clades of domains correlate remarkably well with biological function, as opposed to structural similarity, indicating that the functionally distinct sub-families within these superfolds are homologous. This method extends phylogenetics into the challenging “twilight zone” of sequence similarity, providing the first objective resolution of deep evolutionary relationships among distant protein families.},

Following the extraction of DNA from each dust sample, we targeted the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using Illumina NextSeq sequencing. PERMANOVA analysis of the microbial communities at family level grouped samples within their distinct bioclimatic region and SIMPER analysis at genus level identified the statistically significant taxa responsible for driving diversity between these groups. A “common to all” core house dust microbiome consisted of Acinetobacter, Massalia, Rubellimicrobium, Sphingomonas and Staphylococcus; genera typically associated with human occupancy and common environmental sources. Additionally, a “unique location specific” microbiome was identified, reflective of the bioclimatic region. The Greek dusts indicated a lower average diversity than the UK house dusts, with a high abundance of Rhizobiaceae in the Greek samples. Our study highlights citizen science as a powerful approach to access the indoor residential environment, at scale, and establishes the existence of a “core” house dust microbiome independent of bioclimatic region.}

Traditional approaches use a tabular structure (relational databases) for storing data and thereby complicate storing and retrieving interlinked data from the clinical domain. Graph databases provide a great solution for this by storing data in a graph as nodes (vertices) that are connected by edges (links). The underlying graph structure can be used for the subsequent data analysis (graph learning). Graph learning consists of two parts: graph representation learning and graph analytics. Graph representation learning aims to reduce high-dimensional input graphs to low-dimensional representations. Then, graph analytics uses the obtained representations for analytical tasks like visualization, classification, link prediction and clustering which can be used to solve domain-specific problems. In this survey, we review current state-of-the-art graph database management systems, graph learning algorithms and a variety of graph applications in the clinical domain. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive use case for a clearer understanding of complex graph learning algorithms. Graphical abstract.},

CATH-AlphaFlow uses a novel state-of-the-art structure-based domain boundary prediction method (ChainSaw) for identifying domains in multi-domain proteins. We applied CATH-AlphaFlow to process PDB structures not classified in CATH and AFDB structures from 21 model organisms, expanding CATH by over 100\%. Domains not classified in existing CATH superfamilies or fold groups were used to seed novel folds, giving 253 new folds from PDB structures (September 2023 release) and 96 from AFDB structures of proteomes of 21 model organisms. Where possible, functional annotations were obtained using (i) predictions from publicly available methods (ii) annotations from structural relatives in AFDB/UniProt50. We also predicted functional sites and highly conserved residues. Some folds are associated with important functions such as photosynthetic acclimation (in flowering plants), iron permease activity (in fungi) and post-natal spermatogenesis (in mice). CATH-AlphaFlow will allow us to identify many more CATH relatives in the AFDB, further characterising the protein structure landscape.},

These often facilitate efficient load balancing, low-level system maintenance, server consolidation (for efficient energy and resource utilization) and replication of instances over geographical locations for better fault tolerance to escalate application reliability. However, some recent literature have addressed various challenges (such as complex networking, persistent storage facilities, cross data centers and multicloud supports, security issues, and lack of available, capable container management APIs, etc.) regarding successful container adoption in industries, which might have resulted in a seemingly meager increase in industrial deployments of containerization over the past few years despite bestowing efficient lightweight virtualization. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of containerizations along with their popularity dynamics has still not been found in contemporary literature, which further extends knowledge gap between developers and available technologies. Hence, current study touches upon different technicalities involved in containerization with potential problems and possible solutions along with various important industrial applications to manifest its existing supports and technical hardships. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive experimental study to compare the performance of VMs, containers and unikernels in terms of CPU utilization, memory footprints, network bandwidth, execution time and technological maturity using standard benchmarks and observed containers to deliver satisfactory performance in almost all aspects, however, are still not free from issues regarding isolation \& security, performance stability, lack of available efficient tools for crossplatform support and persistent storage. Unikernels deliver good performance with VM-like isolation but still need to achieve desired technical maturity (in terms of microprocessor stability, process containment, persistent storage, etc.). VMs, on the other hand, are found to provide stable performance throughout, though bigger memory footprints and slower spin up/down remain their biggest weaknesses.},

RESULTS: This article presents Chainsaw, a supervised learning approach to domain parsing that achieves accuracy that surpasses current state-of-the-art methods. Chainsaw uses a fully convolutional neural network which is trained to predict the probability that each pair of residues is in the same domain. Domain predictions are then derived from these pairwise predictions using an algorithm that searches for the most likely assignment of residues to domains given the set of pairwise co-membership probabilities. Chainsaw matches CATH domain annotations in 78\% of protein domains versus 72\% for the next closest method. When predicting on AlphaFold models, expert human evaluators were twice as likely to prefer Chainsaw's predictions versus the next best method.

A nucleus can grow rapidly by adding peptide chain segments that are close to the nucleus in aminoacid sequence. Such a process would generate three-dimensional (native) protein structures that contain separate regions of continuous peptide chain. Possible means of testing this hypothesis are discussed.},

I describe the state of the statistical literature for addressing these problems, focusing on the analysis of microbial diversity. I argue that latent variable models can address issues with variance, but bias corrections need to be utilized as well. I encourage ecologists to use estimates of diversity that account for unobserved species, and to use measurement error models to compare diversity across ecosystems.},

DESIGN: Microbiota profiles in anal swabs collected from 76 MSM (52 in 1989, swab-1; 66 1-5 years later, swab-2) were compared by HIV status (25 HIV-positive), T-cell subsets, and questionnaire data. METHODS: Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified, sequenced (Illumina MiSeq), and clustered into species-level operational taxonomic units (QIIME and Greengenes). Regression models and Wilcoxon tests were used for associations with alpha diversity (unique operational taxonomic units, Shannon's index). Composition was compared by Adonis (QIIME). RESULTS: Most anal bacteria were Firmicutes (mean 60.6\%, range 21.1-91.1\%) or Bacteroidetes (29.4\%, 4.1-70.8\%). Alpha diversity did not change between the two swabs (N = 42 pairs). In swab-2, HIV-positives had lower alpha diversity (P ≤ 0.04) and altered composition, with fewer Firmicutes and more Fusobacteria taxa (P ≤ 0.03), not completely attributable to very low CD4(+) cell count (median 232 cells/μl), prior AIDS clinical diagnosis (N = 17), or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole use (N = 6). Similar but weaker differences were observed in swab-1 (HIV-positive median 580 CD4(+) cells/μl; no trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Associations with T-cell subsets, smoking, and sexual practices were null or inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: The anal microbiota of MSM was relatively stable over 1-5 years. However, with uncontrolled, advanced HIV infection, the microbiota had altered composition and reduced diversity partially attributable to antibiotics. Investigations of microbial community associations with other immune perturbations and clinical abnormalities are needed.},

The existence of multiple sequence solutions for a given fold has inspired fold prediction methods in which structural information from one protein is used to estimate the energy of another, putatively similar, structure. RESULTS: A set of 68 pairs of proteins with similar folds and sequence identity in the 8-30\% range is identified from the literature. for each pair, the energy of one protein, calculated using knowledge-based statistical potentials, is compared to the estimated energy, calculated with the same potentials but using the structural information (burial status and interaction pattern) of another protein with the same fold. Different energy estimates, corresponding to approximations used in various fold recognition algorithms, are calculated and compared to each other, as well as to the correct energy. It is shown that the local energy terms, based on burial and secondary structure preferences, can be reliably estimated with an accuracy close to 70\%. At the same time, the two-body nonlocal energy loses over 60\% of its value due to the repacking of the structure. Further approximations, such as the 'frozen approximation', can bring it to an essentially random value. CONCLUSIONS: Local energy terms could be used safely to improve fold recognition algorithms. To utilize pair interaction information, specially designed pair potentials and/or a self-consistent description of pair interactions is necessary.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Metatranscriptomics (MTX) has become an increasingly practical way to profile the functional activity of microbial communities in situ. However, MTX remains underutilized due to experimental and computational limitations. The latter are complicated by non-independent changes in both RNA transcript levels and their underlying genomic DNA copies (as microbes simultaneously change their overall abundance in the population and regulate individual transcripts), genetic plasticity (as whole loci are frequently gained and lost in microbial lineages) and measurement compositionality and zero-inflation. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of and recommendations for differential expression (DE) analysis in MTX. RESULTS: We designed and assessed six statistical models for DE discovery in MTX that incorporate different combinations of DNA and RNA normalization and assumptions about the underlying changes of gene copies or species abundance within communities. We evaluated these models on multiple simulated and real multi-omic datasets. Models adjusting transcripts relative to their encoding gene copies as a covariate were significantly more accurate in identifying DE from MTX in both simulated and real datasets. Moreover, we show that when paired DNA measurements (metagenomic data) are not available, models normalizing MTX measurements within-species while also adjusting for total-species RNA balance sensitivity, specificity and interpretability of DE detection, as does filtering likely technical zeros. The efficiency and accuracy of these models pave the way for more effective MTX-based DE discovery in microbial communities.
