                  including pollutant remediation, water management, carbon
                  maintenance, and nutrient cycling. However, while the urban
                  soil microbiota underpin these services, we still have limited
                  understanding of the factors that influence their
                  distribution. We characterized soil bacterial communities from
                  turf-grasses associated with urban parks, streets, and
                  residential sites across a major urban environment, including
                  a gradient of human population density. Bacterial diversity
                  was significantly positively correlated with the population
                  density; and species diversity was greater in park and street
                  soils, compared to residential soils. Population density and
                  greenspace type also led to significant differences in the
                  microbial community composition that was also significantly
                  correlated with soil pH, moisture, and texture. Co-occurrence
                  network analysis revealed that microbial guilds in urban soils
                  were well correlated. Abundant soil microbes in high density
                  population areas had fewer interactions, while abundant
                  bacteria in high moisture soils had more interactions. These
                  results indicate the significant influence of changes in urban
                  demographics and land-use on soil microbial communities. As
                  urbanization is rapidly growing across the planet, it is
                  important to improve our understanding of the consequences of
                  urban zoning on the soil microbiota.}

                  participants recruited from randomly selected households to
                  reflect the UK population (England, Scotland, Wales, and
                  Northern Ireland) were divided into the delta cohort (2 July

                  compared with the least deprived group in the delta cohort
                  were 1.59 (95\% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.02) and 1.50
                  (1.19 to 1.87) in the healthcare and manufacturing or
                  construction sectors, respectively. Corresponding values in
                  the omicron cohort were 1.50 (1.15 to 1.95) and 1.43 (1.09 to
                  1.86) in the healthcare and teaching and education sectors,
                  respectively. Associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and
                  other employment sectors were not significant or were not
                  tested because of small numbers.ConclusionIn this study, the
                  risk of a positive test result for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the

                  globally. We included peer-reviewed studies, from any country,
                  written in English that showed any area-level (eg,
                  neighbourhood, town, city, municipality, or region)
                  inequalities in mortality by socioeconomic deprivation (ie,
                  measured via indices of multiple deprivation: the percentage
                  of people living in poverty or proxy factors including the

                  papers from five WHO global regions were included in the final
                  synthesis. A large majority of the studies (n=86) found that
                  COVID-19 mortality rates were higher in areas of socioeconomic
                  disadvantage than in affluent areas. The subsequent discussion

                  increased risk simulated over northern Europe and slightly
                  decreased risk over southern Europe. These distribution shifts
                  are related to wetter and warmer conditions favouring the
                  overwintering of A. albopictus in the north, and drier and

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Dengue is a disease that has undergone significant
                  expansion over the past hundred years. Understanding what
                  factors limit the distribution of transmission can be used to
                  predict current and future limits to further dengue expansion.
                  While not the only factor, temperature plays an important role
                  in defining these limits. Previous attempts to analyse the
                  effect of temperature on the geographic distribution of dengue
                  have not considered its dynamic intra-annual and diurnal
                  change and its cumulative effects on mosquito and virus
                  populations. METHODS: Here we expand an existing modelling
                  framework with new temperature-based relationships to model an
                  index proportional to the basic reproductive number of the
                  dengue virus. This model framework is combined with high
                  spatial and temporal resolution global temperature data to
                  model the effects of temperature on Aedes aegypti and Ae.
                  albopictus persistence and competence for dengue virus
                  transmission. RESULTS: Our model predicted areas where
                  temperature is not expected to permit transmission and/or
                  Aedes persistence throughout the year. By reanalysing existing
                  experimental data our analysis indicates that Ae. albopictus,
                  often considered a minor vector of dengue, has comparable
                  rates of virus dissemination to its primary vector, Ae.
                  aegypti, and when the longer lifespan of Ae. albopictus is
                  considered its competence for dengue virus transmission far
                  exceeds that of Ae. aegypti. CONCLUSIONS: These results can be
                  used to analyse the effects of temperature and other
                  contributing factors on the expansion of dengue or its Aedes
                  vectors. Our finding that Ae. albopictus has a greater
                  capacity for dengue transmission than Ae. aegypti is contrary
                  to current explanations for the comparative rarity of dengue
                  transmission in established Ae. albopictus populations. This
                  suggests that the limited capacity of Ae. albopictus to
                  transmit DENV is more dependent on its ecology than vector
                  competence. The recommendations, which we explicitly outlined
                  here, point to clear targets for entomological investigation.}

  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Protein structure similarity is often measured by
                  root mean squared deviation, global distance test score and
                  template modeling score (TM-score). However, the scores
                  themselves cannot provide information on how significant the
                  structural similarity is. Also, it lacks a quantitative
                  relation between the scores and conventional fold
                  classifications. This article aims to answer two questions:
                  (i) what is the statistical significance of TM-score? (ii)
                  What is the probability of two proteins having the same fold
                  given a specific TM-score? RESULTS: We first made an
                  all-to-all gapless structural match on 6684 non-homologous
                  single-domain proteins in the PDB and found that the TM-scores
                  follow an extreme value distribution. The data allow us to
                  assign each TM-score a P-value that measures the chance of two
                  randomly selected proteins obtaining an equal or higher
                  TM-score. With a TM-score at 0.5, for instance, its P-value is
                  5.5 x 10(-7), which means we need to consider at least 1.8
                  million random protein pairs to acquire a TM-score of no less
                  than 0.5. Second, we examine the posterior probability of the
                  same fold proteins from three datasets SCOP, CATH and the
                  consensus of SCOP and CATH. It is found that the posterior
                  probability from different datasets has a similar rapid phase
                  transition around TM-score=0.5. This finding indicates that
                  TM-score can be used as an approximate but quantitative
                  criterion for protein topology classification, i.e. protein
                  pairs with a TM-score Â¿0.5 are mostly in the same fold while
                  those with a TM-score Â¡0.5 are mainly not in the same fold.}

                  seeks to categorize a dataset into homogeneous groups.
                  However, real data usually contain noise, which poses
                  significant challenges to clustering algorithms. In this
                  article, motivated by how the k -means algorithm is derived
                  from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), we propose a robust k
                  -means-type algorithm, named k -means-type clustering based on
                  t -distribution (KMTD), by assuming that the data points are
                  drawn from a special multivariate t -mixture model (TMM).
                  Compared to the Gaussian distribution, the t -distribution has
                  a fatter tail. The proposed algorithm is more robust to noise.
                  Like the k -means algorithm, the proposed algorithm is simpler
                  than those based on a full TMM. Both synthetic and actual data
                  are used to illustrate the proposed algorithm's performance
                  and efficiency. The experimental results demonstrated that the
                  proposed algorithm operates more quickly than other
                  sophisticated algorithms and, in most cases, achieves higher
                  accuracy than the other algorithms.}

                  inflammation. PCS selectively reduced CCL20 production by
                  airway epithelial cells due to an uncoupling of epidermal
                  growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)

                  that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges,
                  including de novo binder design and design of higher-order
                  symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion
                  models10,11 have had considerable success in image and
                  language generative modelling but limited success when applied
                  to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of
                  protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure
                  relationships. Here we show that by fine-tuning the
                  RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure
                  denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein

                  the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold
                  diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally characterizing the
                  structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric
                  assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The
                  accuracy of RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron
                  microscopy structure of a designed binder in complex with
                  influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly identical to the
                  design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce
                  images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the
                  design of diverse functional proteins from simple molecular

                  algorithms in current use as it is relatively fast yet simple
                  to understand and deploy in practice. Nevertheless, its use
                  entails certain restrictive assumptions about the data, the
                  negative consequences of which are not always immediately
                  apparent, as we demonstrate. While more flexible algorithms
                  have been developed, their widespread use has been hindered by
                  their computational and technical complexity. Motivated by
                  these considerations, we present a flexible alternative to
                  K-means that relaxes most of the assumptions, whilst remaining
                  almost as fast and simple. This novel algorithm which we call
                  MAP-DP (maximum a-posteriori Dirichlet process mixtures), is
                  statistically rigorous as it is based on nonparametric
                  Bayesian Dirichlet process mixture modeling. This approach
                  allows us to overcome most of the limitations imposed by
                  K-means. The number of clusters K is estimated from the data
                  instead of being fixed a-priori as in K-means. In addition,
                  while K-means is restricted to continuous data, the MAP-DP
                  framework can be applied to many kinds of data, for example,
                  binary, count or ordinal data. Also, it can efficiently
                  separate outliers from the data. This additional flexibility
                  does not incur a significant computational overhead compared
                  to K-means with MAP-DP convergence typically achieved in the
                  order of seconds for many practical problems. Finally, in
                  contrast to K-means, since the algorithm is based on an
                  underlying statistical model, the MAP-DP framework can deal
                  with missing data and enables model testing such as cross
                  validation in a principled way. We demonstrate the simplicity
                  and effectiveness of this algorithm on the health informatics
                  problem of clinical sub-typing in a cluster of diseases known
                  as parkinsonism.}

                  held within the resource. Recently, an updated approach to
                  data analysis has been unveiled (version 5.0), replacing the
                  previous single pipeline with multiple analysis pipelines that
                  are tailored according to the input data, and that are
                  formally described using the Common Workflow Language,

                  MGnify's growing focus on the assembly of metagenomic data has
                  also seen the number of datasets it has assembled and analysed
                  increase six-fold. The non-redundant protein database
                  constructed from the proteins encoded by these assemblies now
                  exceeds 1 billion sequences. Meanwhile, a newly developed

                  techniques requires objective criteria to measure the
                  similarity between a computational model and the
                  experimentally determined reference structure. Conventional
                  similarity measures based on a global superposition of carbon
                  Î± atoms are strongly influenced by domain motions and do not
                  assess the accuracy of local atomic details in the model.
                  RESULTS: The Local Distance Difference Test (lDDT) is a
                  superposition-free score that evaluates local distance
                  differences of all atoms in a model, including validation of
                  stereochemical plausibility. The reference can be a single
                  structure, or an ensemble of equivalent structures. We
                  demonstrate that lDDT is well suited to assess local model
                  quality, even in the presence of domain movements, while
                  maintaining good correlation with global measures. These
                  properties make lDDT a robust tool for the automated
                  assessment of structure prediction servers without manual

                  modeling assessments. The two major classes of measures,
                  positional distance-based and contact-based, are presented,
                  compared, and analyzed. The most popular measure of the first
                  class, the global RMSD, is shown to be the least
                  representative of the degree of structural similarity because
                  it is dominated by the largest error. Several

                  drawbacks of RMSD are described. Measures of the second class,
                  contact-based, are shown to be more robust and relevant. We
                  also illustrate the importance of using combined measures,

                  avoid artifacts, we restricted our attention only to the core
                  components of these structures. We found that on average,
                  using different measures of structural change, protein cores
                  evolve linearly with evolutionary distance (amino acid
                  substitutions per site). This is true irrespective of which
                  measure of structural change we used, whether RMSD or discrete
                  structural descriptors for secondary structure, accessibility,
                  or contacts. This linear response allows us to quantify the
                  claim that structure is more conserved than sequence. Using
                  structural alphabets of similar cardinality to the sequence
                  alphabet, structural cores evolve three to ten times slower
                  than sequences. Although we observed an average linear
                  response, we found a wide variance. Different domain families
                  varied fivefold in structural response to evolution. An
                  attempt to categorically analyze this variance among subgroups
                  by structural and functional category revealed only one
                  statistically significant trend. This trend can be explained
                  by the fact that beta-sheets change faster than alpha-helices,
                  most likely due to that they are shorter and that change
                  occurs at the ends of the secondary structure elements.}

                  potential for catalyzing the degradation of per- and
                  polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). AF2 models and experiments
                  identified T7RdhA as a corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CoFeSP)
                  which uses a norpseudo-cobalamin (BVQ) cofactor and two Fe4S4
                  iron-sulfur clusters for catalysis. Docking and molecular
                  dynamics simulations suggest that T7RdhA uses
                  perfluorooctanoic acetate (PFOA) as a substrate, supporting
                  the reported defluorination activity of its homolog, A6RdhA.

                  evolutionary constraints, the Evoformer network of AF2
                  predicts protein structures and residue flexibility in complex
                  with the ligands, i.e., in their native states. Therefore, an
                  apo-protein predicted by AF2 is actually a holo-protein

                  sequences. We performed AF2 structure predictions for various
                  protein systems, including globular proteins, a multi-domain
                  protein, an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), a
                  randomized protein, two larger proteins (Â¿ 1000 AA), a
                  heterodimer and a homodimer protein complex. Our results show
                  that along with the three dimensional (3D) structures, AF2
                  also decodes protein sequences into residue flexibilities via
                  both the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT)
                  scores of the models, and the predicted aligned error (PAE)

                  AF2-scores, which are simply derived from pLDDT scores and are
                  in the range of [0, 1]. We found that for most protein models,
                  including large proteins and protein complexes, the AF2-scores
                  are highly correlated with the root mean square fluctuations
                  (RMSF) calculated from MD simulations. However, for an IDP and
                  a randomized protein, the AF2-scores do not correlate with the
                  RMSF from MD, especially for the IDP. Our results indicate
                  that the protein structures predicted by AF2 also convey
                  information of the residue flexibility, i.e., protein
                  dynamics.}

                  medium accuracy (DockQ [3] â¥ 0.49) on 13 targets and high
                  accuracy (DockQ â¥ 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of
                  at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the
                  previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system
                  from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of
                  4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all
                  non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For
                  heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface
                  (DockQ â¥ 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy
                  predictions (DockQ â¥ 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of
                  +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker
                  modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively. For homomeric
                  inter-faces we successfully predict the interface in 72\% of

               identification in spatial databases. However, the application to
               large spatial databases rises the following requirements for
               clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge
               to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with
               arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The
               well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the
               combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the
               new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion
               of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary
               shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the
               user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an
               experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of
               DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000
               benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1)
               DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of
               arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that
               (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in

                  structures at low resolution where diffraction data are

                  differ a little, the Gini values and median expression levels
                  of the various genes are well correlated with each other
                  between the various cell line datasets, implying that our
                  original choice of the more ubiquitously expressed
                  low-Gini-coefficient genes was indeed sound. In tissues, the
                  Gini values and median expression levels of genes showed a
                  greater variation, with the GC of genes changing with the
                  number and types of tissues in the data sets. In all data
                  sets, regardless of whether this was derived from tissues or
                  cell lines, we also show that the GC is a robust measure of
                  gene expression stability. Using the GC as a measure of
                  expression stability we illustrate its utility to find tissue-
                  and cell line-optimised housekeeping genes without any prior
                  bias, that again include only a small number of previously
                  reported housekeeping genes. We also independently confirmed
                  this experimentally using RT-qPCR with 40 candidate GC genes
                  in a panel of 10 cell lines. These were termed the Gini Genes.
                  In many cases, the variation in the expression levels of
                  classical reference genes is really quite huge (e.g. 44 fold
                  for GAPDH in one data set), suggesting that the cure (of using
                  them as normalising genes) may in some cases be worse than the
                  disease (of not doing so). We recommend the present
                  data-driven approach for the selection of reference genes by
                  using the easy-to-calculate and robust GC.}

                  Crystallographic Information Framework (mmCIF), has become the
                  data standard for structural biology. With its early roots in
                  the domain of small-molecule crystallography, PDBx/mmCIF
                  provides an extensible data representation that is used for
                  deposition, archiving, remediation, and public dissemination
                  of experimentally determined three-dimensional (3D) structures
                  of biological macromolecules by the Worldwide Protein Data
                  Bank (wwPDB, wwpdb.org). Extensions of PDBx/mmCIF are
                  similarly used for computed structure models by ModelArchive
                  (modelarchive.org), integrative/hybrid structures by PDB-Dev
                  (pdb-dev.wwpdb.org), small angle scattering data by Small

                  and methods developers in structural sciences, data repository
                  providers, scientific publishers, and professional societies.
                  Having a semantically rich and extensible data framework for
                  representing a wide range of structural biology experimental
                  and computational results, combined with expertly curated 3D
                  biostructure data sets in public repositories, accelerates the
                  pace of scientific discovery. Herein, we describe the
                  architecture of the PDBx/mmCIF data standard, tools used to
                  maintain representations of the data standard, governance, and

                  similarities among small molecules is important for many
                  analysis routines in drug discovery and chemical genomics.
                  Algorithms used for this purpose include fragment-based
                  fingerprint and graph-based maximum common substructure (MCS)
                  methods. MCS approaches provide one of the most accurate
                  similarity measures. However, their rigid matching policies
                  limit them to the identification of perfect MCSs. To eliminate
                  this restriction, we introduce a new mismatch tolerant search
                  method for identifying flexible MCSs (FMCSs) containing a
                  user-definable number of atom and/or bond mismatches. RESULTS:
                  The fmcsR package provides an R interface, with the
                  time-consuming steps of the FMCS algorithm implemented in C++.
                  It includes utilities for pairwise compound comparisons,
                  structure similarity searching, clustering and visualization
                  of MCSs. In comparison with an existing MCS tool, fmcsR shows
                  better time performance over a wide range of compound sizes.
                  When mismatching of atoms or bonds is turned on, the compute
                  times increase as expected, and the resulting FMCSs are often
                  substantially larger than their strict MCS counterparts. Based
                  on extensive virtual screening (VS) tests, the flexible
                  matching feature enhances the enrichment of active structures
                  at the top of MCS-based similarity search results. With
                  respect to overall and early enrichment performance, FMCS
                  outperforms most of the seven other VS methods considered in
                  these tests. AVAILABILITY: fmcsR is freely available for all
                  common operating systems from the Bioconductor site

                  (PDB) has witnessed rapid accumulation of experimentally
                  solved protein structures. Since many structures are
                  determined with purification and crystallization additives
                  that are unrelated to a protein's in vivo function, it is
                  nontrivial to identify the subset of protein-ligand
                  interactions that are biologically relevant. We developed the
                  BioLiP2 database (https://zhanggroup.org/BioLiP) to extract
                  biologically relevant protein-ligand interactions from the PDB
                  database. BioLiP2 assesses the functional relevance of the
                  ligands by geometric rules and experimental literature
                  validations. The ligand binding information is further
                  enriched with other function annotations, including Enzyme
                  Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms, catalytic sites, and
                  binding affinities collected from other databases and a manual
                  literature survey. Compared to its predecessor BioLiP, BioLiP2
                  offers significantly greater coverage of nucleic acid-protein
                  interactions, and interactions involving large complexes that
                  are unavailable in PDB format. BioLiP2 also integrates
                  cutting-edge structural alignment algorithms with
                  state-of-the-art structure prediction techniques, which for
                  the first time enables composite protein structure and
                  sequence-based searching and significantly enhances the
                  usefulness of the database in structure-based function
                  annotations. With these new developments, BioLiP2 will
                  continue to be an important and comprehensive database for
                  docking, virtual screening, and structure-based protein

                  genome sequences and of high-throughput capabilities to
                  determine gene coexpression patterns has shifted the research
                  focus from the study of single proteins or small complexes to
                  that of the entire proteome. In this context, the search for
                  reliable methods for assigning protein function is of primary
                  importance. There are various approaches available for
                  deducing the function of proteins of unknown function using
                  information derived from sequence similarity or clustering
                  patterns of co-regulated genes, phylogenetic profiles,
                  protein-protein interactions (refs. 5-8 and Samanta, M.P. and
                  Liang, S., unpublished data), and protein complexes. Here we
                  propose the assignment of proteins to functional classes on
                  the basis of their network of physical interactions as
                  determined by minimizing the number of protein interactions
                  among different functional categories. Function assignment is
                  proteome-wide and is determined by the global connectivity
                  pattern of the protein network. The approach results in
                  multiple functional assignments, a consequence of the
                  existence of multiple equivalent solutions. We apply the
                  method to analyze the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
                  protein-protein interaction network. The robustness of the
                  approach is tested in a system containing a high percentage of
                  unclassified proteins and also in cases of deletion and
                  insertion of specific protein interactions.}

                  understand how PLQ enters and leaves PSII, here we show
                  results of coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations of
                  PSII embedded in the thylakoid membrane, covering a total
                  simulation time of more than 0.5 ms. The long time scale
                  allows the observation of many spontaneous entries of PLQ into
                  PSII, and the unbinding of plastoquinol (PLQol) from the
                  complex. In addition to the two known channels, we observe a
                  third channel for PLQ/PLQol diffusion between the thylakoid
                  membrane and the PLQ binding sites. Our simulations point to a
                  promiscuous diffusion mechanism in which all three channels
                  function as entry and exit channels. The exchange cavity
                  serves as a PLQ reservoir. Our simulations provide a direct
                  view on the exchange of electron carriers, a key step of the
                  photosynthesis machinery.}

  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Glycans are biomolecules that take an important
                  role in the biological processes of living organisms. They
                  form diverse, complicated structures such as branched and
                  cyclic forms. Web3 Unique Representation of Carbohydrate
                  Structures (WURCS) was proposed as a new linear notation for
                  uniquely representing glycans during the GlyTouCan project.
                  WURCS defines rules for complex glycan structures that other
                  text formats did not support, and so it is possible to
                  represent a wide variety glycans. However, WURCS uses a
                  complicated nomenclature, so it is not human-readable.
                  Therefore, we aimed to support the interpretation of WURCS by
                  converting WURCS to the most basic and widely used format
                  IUPAC. RESULTS: In this study, we developed
                  GlycanFormatConverter and succeeded in converting WURCS to the
                  three kinds of IUPAC formats (IUPAC-Extended, IUPAC-Condensed
                  and IUPAC-Short). Furthermore, we have implemented
                  functionality to import IUPAC-Extended, KEGG Chemical Function
                  (KCF) and LinearCode formats and to export WURCS. We have
                  thoroughly tested our GlycanFormatConverter and were able to
                  show that it was possible to convert all the glycans
                  registered in the GlyTouCan repository, with exceptions owing
                  only to the limitations of the original format. The source

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: In plants and photosynthetic bacteria, the
                  tyrosine degradation pathway is crucial because homogentisate,
                  a tyrosine degradation product, is a precursor for the
                  biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments, such as quinones or
                  tocophenols. Homogentisate biosynthesis includes a
                  decarboxylation step, a dioxygenation and a rearrangement of
                  the pyruvate sidechain. This complex reaction is carried out
                  by a single enzyme, the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
                  (HPPD), a non-heme iron dependent enzyme that is active as a
                  homotetramer in bacteria and as a homodimer in plants.
                  Moreover, in humans, a HPPD deficiency is found to be related
                  to tyrosinemia, a rare hereditary disorder of tyrosine
                  catabolism. RESULTS: We report here the crystal structure of
                  Pseudomonas fluorescens HPPD refined to 2.4 A resolution
                  (Rfree 27.6\%; R factor 21.9\%). The general topology of the
                  protein comprises two barrel-shaped domains and is similar to
                  the structures of Pseudomonas 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl
                  dioxygenase (DHBD) and Pseudomonas putida catechol
                  2,3-dioxygenase (MPC). Each structural domain contains two
                  repeated betaalpha betabeta betaalpha modules. There is one
                  non-heme iron atom per monomer liganded to the sidechains of
                  His161, His240, Glu322 and one acetate molecule. CONCLUSIONS:
                  The analysis of the HPPD structure and its superposition with
                  the structures of DHBD and MPC highlight some important
                  differences in the active sites of these enzymes. These
                  comparisons also suggest that the pyruvate part of the HPPD
                  substrate (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate) and the O2 molecule would
                  occupy the three free coordination sites of the catalytic iron
                  atom. This substrate-enzyme model will aid the design of new
                  inhibitors of the homogentisate biosynthesis reaction.},

                  Aiming to identify interactions between individual amino acid
                  residues and the role played by each in the context of MD
                  simulations, we present a stand-alone software called gRINN
                  (get Residue Interaction eNergies and Networks). gRINN
                  features graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and a command-line
                  interface for generating and analyzing pairwise residue
                  interaction energies and energy correlations from protein MD
                  simulation trajectories. gRINN utilizes the features of NAMD
                  or GROMACS MD simulation packages and automatizes the steps
                  necessary to extract residue-residue interaction energies from
                  user-supplied simulation trajectories, greatly simplifying the
                  analysis for the end-user. A GUI, including an embedded
                  molecular viewer, is provided for visualization of interaction
                  energy time-series, distributions, an interaction energy
                  matrix, interaction energy correlations and a residue
                  correlation matrix. gRINN additionally offers construction and
                  analysis of Protein Energy Networks, providing residue-based
                  metrics such as degrees, betweenness-centralities, closeness
                  centralities as well as shortest path analysis. gRINN is free
                  and open to all users without login requirement at
                  http://grinn.readthedocs.io.}

                  steps involved in the origin of marine planktonic
                  cyanobacteria. While filamentous cell types evolved early on
                  at around 2,600-2,300 Mya and likely dominated microbial mats
                  in benthic environments for most of the Proterozoic (2,500-542
                  Mya), marine planktonic cyanobacteria evolved towards the end
                  of the Proterozoic and early Phanerozoic. Crown groups of
                  modern terrestrial and/or benthic coastal cyanobacteria
                  appeared during the late Paleoproterozoic to early
                  Mesoproterozoic. Decrease in cell diameter and loss of
                  filamentous forms contributed to the evolution of unicellular
                  planktonic lineages during the middle of the Mesoproterozoic
                  (1,600-1,000 Mya) in freshwater environments. This study shows
                  that marine planktonic cyanobacteria evolved from benthic
                  marine and some diverged from freshwater ancestors during the

                  (5,10-meTHF). In vivo, 5,10-meTHF is the main carrier of
                  one-carbon (1C) units, which are utilized for nucleotide
                  biosynthesis and other processes crucial for every living
                  cell, but hyperactivated in overproliferating cells (e.g.
                  cancer tissues). SHMTs are emerging as a promising target for
                  development of new drugs because it appears possible to
                  inhibit growth of cancer cells by cutting off the supply of
                  5,10-meTHF. Methotrexate (MTX) and pemetrexed (PTX) are two
                  examples of antifolates that have cured many patients over the
                  years but target different enzymes from the folate cycle
                  (mainly dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase,

                  bound to plant SHMT isozymes from cytosol and
                  mitochondria-human isozymes exist in the same subcellular
                  compartments. We verify inhibition of the studied isozymes by
                  a thorough kinetic analysis. We propose to further exploit
                  antifolate scaffold in development of SHMT inhibitors because
                  it seems likely that especially polyglutamylated PTX inhibits
                  SHMTs in vivo. Structure-based optimization is expected to
                  yield novel antifolates that could potentially be used as

                  circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they
                  can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and
                  can represent an essentially infinite number of different
                  molecular features (including stereochemical information);
                  their features represent the presence of particular
                  substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis
                  results; and the ECFP algorithm can be tailored to generate

                  single-molecule methods. DHFR was modified to permit the
                  covalent addition of a fluorescent molecule, Alexa 488, and a
                  biotin at the N terminus of the molecule. The fluorescent
                  molecule was placed on a protein loop that closes over
                  methotrexate when binding occurs, thus causing a quenching of
                  the fluorescence. The biotin was used to attach the enzyme in
                  an active form to a glass surface for single-molecule studies.
                  The equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding of
                  methotrexate to the enzyme is 9.5 nM. The stopped-flow studies
                  revealed that methotrexate binds to two different
                  conformations of the enzyme, and the association and
                  dissociation rate constants were determined. The
                  single-molecule investigation revealed a conformational change
                  in the enzyme-methotrexate complex that was not observed in
                  the stopped-flow studies. The ensemble averaged rate constants
                  for this conformation change in both directions is about 2-4
                  s(-1) and is attributed to the opening and closing of the
                  enzyme loop over the bound methotrexate. Thus the mechanism of
                  methotrexate binding to DHFR involves multiple steps and

                  interactions. RING 2.0 is extremely fast and generates both
                  intra and inter-chain interactions including solvent and
                  ligand atoms. The generated networks are very accurate and
                  reliable thanks to a complex empirical re-parameterization of
                  distance thresholds performed on the entire Protein Data Bank.
                  By default, RING output is generated with optimal parameters
                  but the web server provides an exhaustive interface to
                  customize the calculation. The network can be visualized
                  directly in the browser or in Cytoscape. Alternatively, the
                  RING-Viz script for Pymol allows visualizing the interactions
                  at atomic level in the structure. The web server and RING-Viz,
                  together with an extensive help and tutorial, are available

                  found in the human genome. Understanding the mechanisms by

                  can be used as multifunctional tools for the study of these
                  enzymes. These ionic species bear the same charge as phosphate
                  and the transferring phosphoryl group and, in addition, allow

                  physiological roles and are also very powerful
                  biotechnological tools. These enzymes have been classified
                  into eight different classes (A-H) based on their sequences
                  and biochemical features. By combining structural and sequence
                  analysis, and phylogenetic inference, we have explored the
                  evolutionary history of classes A, B, E, F, and G and
                  demonstrate that their multidomain architectures reflect their
                  phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that the main
                  evolutionary steps in their divergence are likely to have
                  arisen from the recruitment of different domains.
                  Additionally, the functional divergence within in each class
                  appears to have been the result of other mechanisms such as a
                  complex set of single-point mutations. Our results reinforce
                  the idea that a main constraint on the evolution of
                  cofactor-dependent enzymes is the functional binding of the
                  cofactor. Additionally, a remarkable feature of this family is
                  that the sequence of the key flavin adenine
                  dinucleotide-binding domain is split into at least two parts
                  in all classes studied here. We propose a complex set of
                  evolutionary events that gave rise to the origin of the
                  different classes within this family.},

                  Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that
                  is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better
                  visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points
                  together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than
                  existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals
                  structure at many different scales. This is particularly
                  important for high-dimensional data that lie on several
                  different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as
                  images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple

                  function of microbial communities; microbial co-occurrence
                  networks in specific environments have been widely developed
                  to explore these complex systems, but their interconnection
                  pattern across microbiomes in various environments at the
                  global scale remains unexplored. Here, we have inferred an
                  Earth microbial co-occurrence network from a communal catalog
                  with 23,595 samples and 12,646 exact sequence variants from 14
                  environments in the Earth Microbiome Project dataset. RESULTS:
                  This non-random scale-free Earth microbial co-occurrence
                  network consisted of 8 taxonomy distinct modules linked with
                  different environments, which featured environment specific
                  microbial co-occurrence relationships. Different topological
                  features of subnetworks inferred from datasets trimmed into
                  uniform size indicate distinct co-occurrence patterns in the
                  microbiomes of various environments. The high number of
                  specialist edges highlights that environmental specific
                  co-occurrence relationships are essential features across
                  microbiomes. The microbiomes of various environments were
                  clustered into two groups, which were mainly bridged by the
                  microbiomes of plant and animal surface. Acidobacteria Gp2 and
                  Nisaea were identified as hubs in most of subnetworks.
                  Negative edges proportions ranged from 1.9\% in the soil
                  subnetwork to 48.9\% the non-saline surface subnetwork,
                  suggesting various environments experience distinct

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Protein domains are evolutionarily conserved
                  building blocks for protein structure and function, which are
                  conventionally identified based on protein sequence or
                  structure similarity. Small molecule binding domains are of
                  great importance for the recognition of small molecules in
                  biological systems and drug development. Many small molecules,
                  including drugs, have been increasingly identified to bind to
                  multiple targets, leading to promiscuous interactions with
                  protein domains. Thus, a large scale characterization of the
                  protein domains and their associations with respect to
                  small-molecule binding is of particular interest to system
                  biology research, drug target identification, as well as drug
                  repurposing. METHODS: We compiled a collection of 13,822
                  physical interactions of small molecules and protein domains
                  derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Based on
                  the chemical similarity of these small molecules, we
                  characterized pairwise associations of the protein domains and
                  further investigated their global associations from a network
                  point of view. RESULTS: We found that protein domains, despite
                  lack of similarity in sequence and structure, were
                  comprehensively associated through binding the same or similar
                  small-molecule ligands. Moreover, we identified modules in the
                  domain network that consisted of closely related protein
                  domains by sharing similar biochemical mechanisms, being
                  involved in relevant biological pathways, or being regulated
                  by the same cognate cofactors. CONCLUSIONS: A novel protein
                  domain relationship was identified in the context of
                  small-molecule binding, which is complementary to those
                  identified by traditional sequence-based or structure-based
                  approaches. The protein domain network constructed in the
                  present study provides a novel perspective for chemogenomic
                  study and network pharmacology, as well as target
                  identification for drug repurposing.},

  abstract     = {BigSMILES, a line notation for encapsulating the molecular
                  structure of stochastic molecules such as polymers, was
                  recently proposed as a compact and readable solution for
                  writing macromolecules. While BigSMILES strings serve as
                  useful identifiers for reconstructing the molecular
                  connectivity for polymers, in general, BigSMILES allows the
                  same polymer to be codified into multiple equally valid
                  representations. Having a canonicalization scheme that
                  eliminates the multiplicity would be very useful in reducing
                  time-intensive tasks like structural comparison and molecular
                  search into simple string-matching tasks. Motivated by this,
                  in this work, two strategies for deriving canonical
                  representations for linear polymers are proposed. In the first
                  approach, a canonicalization scheme is proposed to standardize
                  the expression of BigSMILES stochastic objects, thereby
                  standardizing the expression of overall BigSMILES strings. In
                  the second approach, an analogy between formal language theory
                  and the molecular ensemble of polymer molecules is drawn.
                  Linear polymers can be converted into regular languages, and
                  the minimal deterministic finite automaton uniquely associated
                  with each prescribed language is used as the basis for
                  constructing the unique text identifier associated with each
                  distinct polymer. Overall, this work presents algorithms to
                  convert linear polymers into unique structure-based text
                  identifiers. The derived identifiers can be readily applied in
                  chemical information systems for polymers and other polymer
                  informatics applications.}

                  myriad of different conformations. Protein side chains change
                  their states during dynamics, causing clashes that are
                  propagated at distal sites. A convenient formalism to analyze
                  protein dynamics is based on network theory using Protein
                  Structure Networks (PSNs). Despite their broad applicability,
                  few efforts have been devoted to benchmarking PSN methods and
                  to provide the community with best practices. In many
                  applications, it is convenient to use the centers of mass of
                  the side chains as nodes. It becomes thus critical to evaluate
                  the minimal distance cutoff between the centers of mass which
                  will provide stable network properties. Moreover, when the PSN
                  is derived from a structural ensemble collected by molecular
                  dynamics (MD), the impact of the MD force field has to be
                  evaluated. We selected a dataset of proteins with different
                  fold and size and assessed the two fundamental properties of
                  the PSN, i.e. hubs and connected components. We identified an
                  optimal cutoff of 5 Ã that is robust to changes in the force
                  field and the proteins. Our study builds solid foundations for
                  the harmonization and standardization of the PSN approach.}

                  hazardous material, is found in low concentrations in the
                  environment and emerges from natural sources and anthropogenic
                  activities. The presence of As in ground water, which is used
                  for irrigation, is a matter of great concern since it affects
                  crop productivity and contaminates food chain. In plants, As
                  alters various metabolic pathways in cells including the
                  interaction of substrates/enzymes with the sulfhydryl groups
                  of proteins and the replacement of phosphate in ATP for
                  energy. In addition, As stimulates the generation of free
                  radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in
                  oxidative stress. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) quench
                  reactive molecules with the addition of glutathione (GSH) and
                  protect the cell from oxidative damage. GSTs are a multigene
                  family of isozymes, known to catalyze the conjugation of GSH
                  to miscellany of electrophilic and hydrophobic substrates.
                  GSTs have been reported to be associated with plant
                  developmental processes and are responsive to multitude of
                  stressors. In past, several studies suggested involvement of
                  plant GST gene family in As response due to the requirement of
                  sulfur and GSH in the detoxification of this toxic metalloid.

                  GSTs in abiotic and biotic stresses with an emphasis on As

                  protein stability. Computational methods are available to
                  predict the effect of single amino acid substitutions (SASs)
                  on protein stability based on a single folded structure.
                  However, the native state of a protein is not unique and it is
                  better represented by the ensemble of its conformers in
                  dynamic equilibrium. The maintenance of the ensemble is
                  essential for protein function. In this work we investigated
                  how protein conformational diversity can affect the
                  discrimination of neutral and disease related SASs based on
                  protein stability estimations. For this purpose, we used 119
                  proteins with 803 associated SASs, 60\% of which are disease
                  related. Each protein was associated with its corresponding
                  set of available conformers as found in the Protein
                  Conformational Database (PCDB). Our dataset contains proteins
                  with different extensions of conformational diversity summing
                  up a total number of 1023 conformers. RESULTS: The existence
                  of different conformers for a given protein introduces great
                  variability in the estimation of the protein stability (ÎÎG)
                  after a single amino acid substitution (SAS) as computed with
                  FoldX. Indeed, in 35\% of our protein set at least one SAS can
                  be described as stabilizing, destabilizing or neutral when a
                  cutoff value of Â±2 kcal/mol is adopted for discriminating
                  neutral from perturbing SASs. However, when the ÎÎG
                  variability among conformers is taken into account, the
                  correlation among the perturbation of protein stability and
                  the corresponding disease or neutral phenotype increases as
                  compared with the same analysis on single protein structures.
                  At the conformer level, we also found that the different
                  conformers correlate in a different way to the corresponding
                  phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the
                  consideration of conformational diversity can improve the
                  discrimination of neutral and disease related protein SASs
                  based on the evaluation of the corresponding Gibbs free energy
                  change.}

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: In higher multicellular eukaryotes, complex
                  protein domain combinations contribute to various cellular
                  functions such as regulation of intercellular or intracellular
                  signaling and interactions. To elucidate the characteristics
                  and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie such domain
                  combinations, it is essential to examine the different types
                  of domains and their combinations among different groups of
                  eukaryotes. RESULTS: We observed a large number of
                  group-specific domain combinations in animals, especially in
                  vertebrates. Examples include animal-specific combinations in
                  tyrosine phosphorylation systems and vertebrate-specific
                  combinations in complement and coagulation cascades. These
                  systems apparently underwent extensive evolution in the
                  ancestors of these groups. In extant animals, especially in
                  vertebrates, animal-specific domains have greater connectivity
                  than do other domains on average, and contribute to the
                  varying number of combinations in each animal subgroup. In
                  other groups, the connectivities of older domains were greater
                  on average. To observe the global behavior of domain
                  combinations during evolution, we traced the changes in domain
                  combinations among animals and fungi in a network analysis.
                  Our results indicate that there is a correlation between the
                  differences in domain combinations among different
                  phylogenetic groups and different global behaviors.
                  CONCLUSION: Rapid emergence of animal-specific domains was
                  observed in animals, contributing to specific domain
                  combinations and functional diversification, but no such
                  trends were observed in other clades of eukaryotes. We
                  therefore suggest that the strategy for achieving complex
                  multicellular systems in animals differs from that of other
                  eukaryotes.}

                  available structure databases. We have found that none of the
                  existing structural encoding schemata are capable of coping
                  with the full complexity to be expected for experimentally
                  derived structural carbohydrate sequence data across all
                  taxonomic sources. This gap motivated us to define an encoding
                  scheme for complex carbohydrates, named GlycoCT, to overcome
                  the current limitations. This new format is based on a
                  connection table approach, instead of a linear encoding
                  scheme, to describe the carbohydrate sequences, with a
                  controlled vocabulary to name monosaccharides, adopting IUPAC
                  rules to generate a consistent, machine-readable nomenclature.
                  The format uses a block concept to describe frequently
                  occurring special features of carbohydrate sequences like
                  repeating units. It exists in two variants, a condensed form
                  and a more verbose XML syntax. Sorting rules assure the
                  uniqueness of the condensed form, thus making it suitable as a
                  direct primary key for database applications, which rely on
                  unique identifiers. GlycoCT encompasses the capabilities of
                  the heterogeneous landscape of digital encoding schemata in
                  glycomics and is thus a step forward on the way to a unified

                  CBM51, which was previously annotated in data bases as the
                  novel putative CBM domain. The high resolution crystal
                  structures of two CBM51 members, GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51, from
                  a putative family 95 alpha-fucosidase and from a family 98
                  blood group A/B antigen-specific endo-beta-galactosidase,
                  respectively, showed them to have highly similar beta-sandwich
                  folds. However, GH95CBM51 was shown by glycan microarray
                  screening, isothermal titration calorimetry, and x-ray
                  crystallography to bind galactose residues, whereas the same
                  analyses of GH98CBM51 revealed specificity for the blood group
                  A/B antigens through non-conserved interactions. Overall, this
                  work identifies a new family of CBMs with many members having
                  apparent specificity for eukaryotic glycans, in keeping with
                  the glycan-rich environment C. perfringens would experience in
                  its host. However, a wider bioinformatic analysis of this CBM
                  family also indicated a large number of members in
                  non-pathogenic environmental bacteria, suggesting a role in
                  the recognition of environmental glycans.}

                  marine environment and contribute to an estimated 16\% of the
                  ocean net primary productivity. Their light-harvesting
                  complexes, called phycobilisomes (PBS), are composed of a
                  conserved allophycocyanin core, from which radiates six to
                  eight rods with variable phycobiliprotein and chromophore
                  content. This variability allows Synechococcus cells to
                  optimally exploit the wide variety of spectral niches existing
                  in marine ecosystems. Seven distinct pigment types or subtypes
                  have been identified so far in this taxon based on the
                  phycobiliprotein composition and/or the proportion of the
                  different chromophores in PBS rods. Most genes involved in
                  their biosynthesis and regulation are located in a dedicated
                  genomic region called the PBS rod region. Here, we examine the
                  variability of gene content and organization of this genomic
                  region in a large set of sequenced isolates and natural
                  populations of Synechococcus representative of all known
                  pigment types. All regions start with a tRNA-PheGAA and some
                  possess mobile elements for DNA integration and site-specific
                  recombination, suggesting that their genomic variability
                  relies in part on a âtycheposonâ-like mechanism. Comparison of
                  the phylogenies obtained for PBS and core genes revealed that
                  the evolutionary history of PBS rod genes differs from the
                  core genome and is characterized by the co-existence of
                  different alleles and frequent allelic exchange. We propose a
                  scenario for the evolution of the different pigment types and
                  highlight the importance of incomplete lineage sorting in
                  maintaining a wide diversity of pigment types in different
                  Synechococcus lineages despite multiple speciation events.},

                  Here, we introduce DeepFRI, a Graph Convolutional Network for
                  predicting protein functions by leveraging sequence features
                  extracted from a protein language model and protein
                  structures. It outperforms current leading methods and
                  sequence-based Convolutional Neural Networks and scales to the
                  size of current sequence repositories. Augmenting the training
                  set of experimental structures with homology models allows us
                  to significantly expand the number of predictable functions.
                  DeepFRI has significant de-noising capability, with only a
                  minor drop in performance when experimental structures are
                  replaced by protein models. Class activation mapping allows
                  function predictions at an unprecedented resolution, allowing
                  site-specific annotations at the residue-level in an automated
                  manner. We show the utility and high performance of our method
                  by annotating structures from the PDB and SWISS-MODEL, making
                  several new confident function predictions. DeepFRI is

                  integration of glycan data across various databases. GlyTouCan
                  assigns accession numbers to glycans which are defined as sets
                  of monosaccharides, which may or may not be characterized with

                  structures at the level of Pfam domains and amino acid
                  residues. This detailed knowledge relies on the fact that
                  there are a large number of multidomain proteins and protein
                  complexes being deposited in the structure databases. The
                  resource called iPfam is hosted within the Pfam UK website.
                  Most resources focus on the interactions between proteins;
                  iPfam includes these as well as interactions between domains

                  mitochondrial-flavoprotein that, after cell death induction,
                  is distributed to the nucleus to mediate chromatinolysis. In
                  mitochondria, AIF is present in a monomer-dimer equilibrium
                  that after reduction by NADH gets displaced toward the dimer.
                  The crystal structure of the human AIF (hAIF):NAD(H)-bound
                  dimer revealed one FAD and, unexpectedly, two NAD(H) molecules
                  per protomer. A 1:2 hAIF:NAD(H) binding stoichiometry was
                  additionally confirmed in solution by using surface plasmon
                  resonance. The here newly discovered NAD(H)-binding site
                  includes residues mutated in human disorders, and
                  accommodation of the coenzyme in it requires restructuring of
                  a hAIF portion within the 509-560 apoptogenic segment.
                  Disruption of interactions at the dimerization surface by
                  production of the hAIF E413A/R422A/R430A mutant resulted in a
                  nondimerizable variant considerably less efficiently
                  stabilizing charge-transfer complexes upon coenzyme reduction
                  than WT hAIF. These data reveal that the coenzyme-mediated
                  monomer-dimer transition of hAIF modulates the conformation of
                  its C-terminal proapoptotic domain, as well as its mechanism
                  as reductase. These observations suggest that both the
                  mitochondrial and apoptotic functions of hAIF are
                  interconnected and coenzyme controlled: a key information in
                  the understanding of the physiological role of AIF in the
                  cellular life and death cycle.}

                  were originally constructed and optimized for substructure
                  searching. We report on improvements in the performance of MDL
                  keysets which are reoptimized for use in molecular similarity.
                  Classification performance for a test data set of 957
                  compounds was increased from 0.65 for the 166 bit keyset and
                  0.67 for the 960 bit keyset to 0.71 for a surprisal S/N pruned
                  keyset containing 208 bits and 0.71 for a genetic algorithm
                  optimized keyset containing 548 bits. We present an overview
                  of the underlying technology supporting the definition of
                  descriptors and the encoding of these descriptors into
                  keysets. This technology allows definition of descriptors as
                  combinations of atom properties, bond properties, and atomic
                  neighborhoods at various topological separations as well as
                  supporting a number of custom descriptors. These descriptors
                  can then be used to set one or more bits in a keyset. We
                  constructed various keysets and optimized their performance in
                  clustering bioactive substances. Performance was measured
                  using methodology developed by Briem and Lessel. âDirected
                  pruningâ was carried out by eliminating bits from the keysets
                  on the basis of random selection, values of the surprisal of
                  the bit, or values of the surprisal S/N ratio of the bit. The
                  random pruning experiment highlighted the insensitivity of
                  keyset performance for keyset lengths of more than 1000 bits.
                  Contrary to initial expectations, pruning on the basis of the
                  surprisal values of the various bits resulted in keysets which
                  underperformed those resulting from random pruning. In
                  contrast, pruning on the basis of the surprisal S/N ratio was
                  found to yield keysets which performed better than those
                  resulting from random pruning. We also explored the use of
                  genetic algorithms in the selection of optimal keysets. Once
                  more the performance was only a weak function of keyset size,
                  and the optimizations failed to identify a single globally
                  optimal keyset. Instead multiple, equally optimal keysets
                  could be produced which had relatively low overlap of the
                  descriptors they encoded.}

                  in dedicated databases in residue-based notations. Only a few
                  of them can be converted into chemical (atom-based) formats
                  highly demanded in conformational and biochemical studies. In
                  this work, we present a tool for translation from a
                  residue-based glycan notation to SMILES. Results: The REStLESS
                  algorithm for translation from the CSDB Linear notation to
                  SMILES was developed. REStLESS stands for ResiduEs as Smiles
                  and LinkagEs as SmartS, where SMARTS reaction expressions are
                  used to merge pre-encoded residues into a molecule. The
                  implementation supports virtually all structural features
                  reported in natural carbohydrates and glycoconjugates. The
                  translator is equipped with a mechanism for conversion of
                  SMILES strings into optimized atomic coordinates which can be
                  used as starting geometries for various computational tasks.
                  Availability and implementation: REStLESS is integrated in the
                  Carbohydrate Structure Database (CSDB) and is freely available
                  on the web (http://csdb.glycoscience.ru/csdb2atoms.html).

                  been used for in meso crystallization of membrane proteins.
                  The crystals have subsequently provided high-resolution
                  structures by crystallographic means. It is possible that the
                  hosting cubic phase created by monoolein alone, which itself
                  is not a common membrane component, will limit the range of
                  membrane proteins crystallizable by the in meso method. With a
                  view to expanding the range of applicability of the method, we
                  investigated by x-ray diffraction the degree to which the
                  reference cubic-Pn3m phase formed by hydrated monoolein could
                  be modified by other lipid types. These included
                  phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine,
                  phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin, lyso-PC, a polyethylene
                  glycol-lipid, 2-monoolein, oleamide, and cholesterol. The
                  results show that all nine lipids were accommodated in the
                  cubic phase to some extent without altering phase identity.
                  The positional isomer, 2-monoolein, was tolerated to the
                  highest level. The least well tolerated were the anionic
                  lipids, followed by lyso-PC. The others were accommodated to
                  the extent of 20-25 mol \%. Beyond a certain concentration
                  limit, the lipid additives either triggered one or a series of
                  phase transitions or saturated the phase and separated out as
                  crystals, as seen with oleamide and cholesterol. The series of
                  phases observed and their order of appearance were consistent
                  with expectations in terms of interfacial curvature changes.
                  The changes in phase type and microstructure have been
                  rationalized on the basis of lipid molecular shape,
                  interfacial curvature, and chain packing energy. The data
                  should prove useful in the rational design of cubic phase
                  crystallization matrices with different lipid profiles that
                  match the needs of a greater range of membrane proteins.}

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Molecular fingerprints are essential
                  cheminformatics tools for virtual screening and mapping
                  chemical space. Among the different types of fingerprints,
                  substructure fingerprints perform best for small molecules
                  such as drugs, while atom-pair fingerprints are preferable for
                  large molecules such as peptides. However, no available
                  fingerprint achieves good performance on both classes of
                  molecules. RESULTS: Here we set out to design a new
                  fingerprint suitable for both small and large molecules by
                  combining substructure and atom-pair concepts. Our quest
                  resulted in a new fingerprint called MinHashed atom-pair
                  fingerprint up to a diameter of four bonds (MAP4). In this
                  fingerprint the circular substructures with radii of r = 1 and
                  r = 2 bonds around each atom in an atom-pair are written as
                  two pairs of SMILES, each pair being combined with the
                  topological distance separating the two central atoms. These
                  so-called atom-pair molecular shingles are hashed, and the
                  resulting set of hashes is MinHashed to form the MAP4
                  fingerprint. MAP4 significantly outperforms all other
                  fingerprints on an extended benchmark that combines the
                  Riniker and Landrum small molecule benchmark with a peptide
                  benchmark recovering BLAST analogs from either scrambled or
                  point mutation analogs. MAP4 furthermore produces
                  well-organized chemical space tree-maps (TMAPs) for databases
                  as diverse as DrugBank, ChEMBL, SwissProt and the Human
                  Metabolome Database (HMBD), and differentiates between all
                  metabolites in HMBD, over 70\% of which are indistinguishable
                  from their nearest neighbor using substructure fingerprints.
                  CONCLUSION: MAP4 is a new molecular fingerprint suitable for
                  drugs, biomolecules, and the metabolome and can be adopted as
                  a universal fingerprint to describe and search chemical space.

                  experiencing what can only be described as explosive growth.
                  This timely, comprehensive and up-to-date review introduces
                  the reader to the practice of in meso crystallogenesis, to the
                  associated challenges and to their solutions. A model of how
                  crystallization comes about mechanistically is presented for a
                  more rational approach to crystallization. The possible
                  involvement of the lamellar and inverted hexagonal phases in
                  crystallogenesis and the application of the method to
                  water-soluble, monotopic and lipid-anchored proteins are
                  addressed. How to set up trials manually and automatically
                  with a robot is introduced with reference to open-access
                  online videos that provide a practical guide to all aspects of
                  the method. These range from protein reconstitution to crystal
                  harvesting from the hosting mesophase, which is noted for its
                  viscosity and stickiness. The sponge phase, as an alternative
                  medium in which to perform crystallization, is described. The
                  compatibility of the method with additive lipids, detergents,
                  precipitant-screen components and materials carried along with
                  the protein such as denaturants and reducing agents is
                  considered. The powerful host and additive lipid-screening
                  strategies are described along with how samples that have low
                  protein concentration and cell-free expressed protein can be
                  used. Assaying the protein reconstituted in the bilayer of the
                  cubic phase for function is an important element of quality
                  control and is detailed. Host lipid design for crystallization
                  at low temperatures and for large proteins and complexes is
                  outlined. Experimental phasing by heavy-atom derivatization,
                  soaking or co-crystallization is routine and the approaches
                  that have been implemented to date are described. An overview
                  and a breakdown by family and function of the close to 200
                  published structures that have been obtained using in
                  meso-grown crystals are given. Recommendations for conducting
                  the screening process to give a more productive outcome are
                  summarized. The fact that the in meso method also works with
                  soluble proteins should not be overlooked. Recent applications
                  of the method for in situ serial crystallography at X-ray
                  free-electron lasers and synchrotrons are described. The
                  review ends with a view to the future and to the bright
                  prospects for the method, which continues to contribute to our
                  understanding of the molecular mechanisms of some of nature's

                  emerging cellular systems. Here, we generate a historical
                  account of the gradual discovery of primordial proteins,
                  cofactors, and molecular functions using phylogenomic
                  information in the sequence of 420 genomes. We focus on
                  structural and functional annotations of the 54 most ancient
                  protein domains. We show how primordial functions are linked
                  to folded structures and how their interaction with cofactors
                  expanded the functional repertoire. We also reveal protocell
                  membranes played a crucial role in early protein evolution and
                  show translation started with RNA and thioester
                  cofactor-mediated aminoacylation. Our findings allow
                  elaboration of an evolutionary model of early biochemistry
                  that is firmly grounded in phylogenomic information and
                  biochemical, biophysical, and structural knowledge. The model
                  describes how primordial Î±-helical bundles stabilized
                  membranes, how these were decorated by layered arrangements of
                  Î²-sheets and Î±-helices, and how these arrangements became
                  globular. Ancient forms of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)
                  catalytic domains and ancient non-ribosomal protein synthetase
                  (NRPS) modules gave rise to primordial protein synthesis and
                  the ability to generate a code for specificity in their active
                  sites. These structures diversified producing cofactor-binding
                  molecular switches and barrel structures. Accretion of domains
                  and molecules gave rise to modern aaRSs, NRPS, and ribosomal
                  ensembles, first organized around novel emerging cofactors
                  (tRNA and carrier proteins) and then more complex cofactor
                  structures (rRNA). The model explains how the generation of
                  protein structures acted as scaffold for nucleic acids and
                  resulted in crystallization of modern translation.}

                  process of gene duplication and combination. The genes
                  involved in this process usually code for whole domains. Small
                  proteins contain one domain; medium and large proteins contain
                  two or more domains. We have compared homologous domains that
                  occur in both one-domain proteins and multidomain proteins. We
                  have determined (1) how the functions of the individual
                  domains in the multidomain proteins combine to produce their
                  overall functions and (2) the extent to which these functions
                  are similar to those in the one-domain homologs. We describe
                  how domain combinations increase the specificity of enzymes;
                  act as links between domains that have functional roles;
                  regulate activity; combine within one chain functions that can
                  act either independently, in concert or in new contexts; and
                  provide the structural framework for the evolution of entirely

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: In order to develop hypothesis on unknown
                  metabolic pathways, biochemists frequently rely on literature
                  that uses a free-text format to describe functional groups or
                  substructures. In computational chemistry or cheminformatics,
                  molecules are typically represented by chemical descriptors,
                  i.e., vectors that summarize information on its various
                  properties. However, it is difficult to interpret these
                  chemical descriptors since they are not directly linked to the
                  terminology of functional groups or substructures that the
                  biochemists use. METHODS: In this study, we used KEGG Chemical
                  Function (KCF) format to computationally describe biochemical
                  substructures in seven attributes that resemble biochemists'
                  way of dealing with substructures. RESULTS: We established
                  KCF-S (KCF-and-Substructures) format as an additional
                  structural information of KCF. Applying KCF-S revealed the
                  specific appearance of substructures from various datasets of
                  molecules that describes the characteristics of the respective
                  datasets. Structure-based clustering of molecules using KCF-S
                  resulted the clusters in which molecular weights and
                  structures were less diverse than those obtained by
                  conventional chemical fingerprints. We further applied KCF-S
                  to find the pairs of molecules that are possibly converted to
                  each other in enzymatic reactions, and KCF-S clearly improved
                  predictive performance than that presented previously.
                  CONCLUSIONS: KCF-S defines biochemical substructures with
                  keeping interpretability, suggesting the potential to apply
                  more studies on chemical bioinformatics. KCF and KCF-S can be
                  automatically converted from Molfile format, enabling to deal
                  with molecules from any data sources.}

                  aluminium or beryllium and it has been suggested that AIF4-
                  acts as an analogue of the gamma-phosphate of GTP in the
                  nucleotide site. We have investigated the action of AIF4- or
                  of BeF3- on transducin (T), the G protein of the retinal rods,
                  either indirectly through the activation of cGMP
                  phosphodiesterase, or more directly through their effects on
                  the conformation of transducin itself. In the presence of
                  AIF4- or BeF3-, purified T alpha subunit of transducin
                  activates purified cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) in the
                  absence of photoactivated rhodopsin. Activation is totally
                  reversed by elution of fluoride or partially reversed by
                  addition of excess T beta gamma. Activation requires that GDP
                  or a suitable analogue be bound to T alpha: T alpha-GDP and T
                  alpha-GDP alpha S are activable by fluorides, but not T
                  alpha-GDP beta S, nor T alpha that has released its nucleotide
                  upon binding to photoexcited rhodopsin. Analysis of previous
                  works on other G proteins and with other nucleotide analogues
                  confirm that in all cases fluoride activation requires that a
                  GDP unsubstituted at its beta phosphate be bound in T alpha.
                  By contrast with alumino-fluoride complexes, which can adopt
                  various coordination geometries, all beryllium fluoride
                  complexes are tetracoordinated, with a Be-F bond length of
                  1.55 A, and strictly isomorphous to a phosphate group. Our
                  study confirms that fluoride activation of transducin results
                  from a reversible binding of the metal-fluoride complex in the
                  nucleotide site of T alpha, next to the beta phosphate of GDP,

                  agents is extremely urgent, and the viral structural proteins
                  are particularly important as potential drug targets.
                  SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein is one of the main structural
                  proteins of the virus, which is involved in multiple processes

                  human coronaviruses. We then explored the role of E protein in

                  currently deployed globally. Independent lineages of

                  the D614G substitution in S results in subtle increases in
                  binding and replication in vitro, and provides a real
                  competitive advantage in vivo-particularly during the
                  transmission bottleneck. Our data therefore provide an
                  explanation for the global predominance of the variant that
                  contains S(D614G) among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are
                  currently circulating.}

                  2 (SARS-CoV-2) had become a global concern because of its
                  unexpectedly high pathogenicity and transmissibility.
                  SARS-CoV-2 variants that reduce the immune protection elicited
                  from previous vaccination or natural infection raise
                  challenges in controlling the spread of the pandemic. The
                  development of universal vaccines against these variants seems
                  to be a practical solution to alleviate the physical and
                  economic effects caused by this disease, but it is hard to
                  achieve. In this review, we describe the high mutation rate of
                  RNA viruses and dynamic molecular structures of SARS-CoV-2
                  variants in several major neutralizing epitopes, trying to
                  answer the question of why universal vaccines are difficult to
                  design. Understanding the biological basis of immune evasion
                  is crucial for combating these obstacles. We then summarize
                  several advancements worthy of further study, including
                  heterologous prime-boost regimens, construction of chimeric
                  immunogens, design of protein nanoparticle antigens, and
                  utilization of conserved neutralizing epitopes. The fact that
                  some immunogens can induce cross-reactive immune responses
                  against heterologous coronaviruses provides hints for
                  universal vaccine development. We hope this review can provide

                  SARS-CoV-2 M protein in two different conformations. M protein
                  forms a mushroom-shaped dimer, composed of two transmembrane
                  domain-swapped three-helix bundles and two intravirion

                  regulate several biological processes as cell proliferation
                  and differentiation, inflammation, immunity and tumor
                  progression. Ubiquitination plays a key role in NF-ÎºB
                  activation and the ubiquitylated transmitters of the NF-ÎºB
                  signaling cascade accumulate in close proximity to
                  endomembranes. FINDINGS: We performed an unbiased siRNA
                  library screen targeting the 46 E3 ubiquitin ligases bearing
                  transmembrane domains to uncover new modulators of NF-ÎºB
                  activation, using tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) receptor
                  (TNFR) stimulation as a model. We report here the
                  identification of a new Golgi Apparatus-resident protein,
                  RNF121, as an enhancer of NF-ÎºB promoter activity through the
                  catalytic function of its RING domain. From a molecular
                  standpoint, while knocking down RNF121 did not alter RIP1
                  ubiquitination and IKK activation, the proteasomal degradation
                  of IÎºBÎ± was impaired suggesting that this E3 ubiquitin ligase
                  regulates this process. However, RNF121 did not directly
                  ubiquitinate IÎºBÎ± While they were found in the same complex.
                  Finally, we discovered that RNF121 acts as a broad regulator
                  of NF-ÎºB signaling since its silencing also dampens NF-ÎºB
                  activation following stimulation of Toll-Like Receptors
                  (TLRs), Nod-Like Receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-Like Receptors (RLRs)
                  or after DNA damages. CONCLUSIONS: These results unveil an
                  unexpected role of Golgi Apparatus and reveal RNF121 as a new
                  player involved in the signaling leading to NF-ÎºB activation.}

                  S protein synthesis, processing, or incorporation into
                  SARS-CoV-2 particles, but D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced

                  Despite the initial success of vaccines at preventing

                  variants capable of higher infectivity. Mutations in the
                  SARS-CoV-2 genome are the consequence of replication errors,
                  highlighting the importance of understanding the determinants
                  of SARS-CoV-2 replication fidelity. The RNA-dependent RNA
                  polymerase (RdRp) is the central catalytic subunit for
                  SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication and genome transcription. Here, we
                  report the fidelity of ribonucleotide incorporation by
                  SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (nsp12), along with its co-factors nsp7/nsp8,
                  using steady-state kinetic analysis. Our analysis suggests
                  that in the absence of the proofreading subunit (nsp14), the

                  fidelity (10-1-10-3). This is orders of magnitude lower than
                  the fidelity reported for other coronaviruses (10-6-10-7),

                  SARS-CoV-2 replication. We performed a mutational analysis of

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The receptor-binding domain (RBD) variants of
                  SARS-CoV-2 could impair antibody-mediated neutralization of
                  the virus by host immunity; thus, prospective surveillance of
                  antibody escape mutants and understanding the evolution of RBD
                  are urgently needed. METHODS: Using the single B cell cloning
                  technology, we isolated and characterized 93 RBD-specific
                  antibodies from the memory B cells of four COVID-19
                  convalescent individuals in the early stage of the pandemic.
                  Then, global RBD alanine scanning with a panel of 19 selected
                  neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), including several broadly
                  reactive NAbs, was performed. Furthermore, we assessed the
                  impact of single natural mutation or co-mutations of concern
                  at key positions of RBD on the neutralization escape and ACE2
                  binding function by recombinant proteins and pseudoviruses.
                  RESULTS: Thirty-three amino acid positions within four
                  independent antigenic sites (1 to 4) of RBD were identified as
                  valuable indicators of antigenic changes in the RBD. The
                  comprehensive escape mutation map not only confirms the widely
                  circulating strains carrying important immune escape RBD
                  mutations such as K417N, E484K, and L452R, but also
                  facilitates the discovery of new immune escape-enabling
                  mutations such as F486L, N450K, F490S, and R346S. Of note,
                  these escape mutations could not affect the ACE2 binding
                  affinity of RBD, among which L452R even enhanced binding.
                  Furthermore, we showed that RBD co-mutations K417N, E484K, and
                  N501Y present in B.1.351 appear more resistant to NAbs and
                  human convalescent plasma from the early stage of the
                  pandemic, possibly due to an additive effect. Conversely,
                  double mutations E484Q and L452R present in B.1.617.1 variant
                  show partial antibody evasion with no evidence for an additive
                  effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a global view of the
                  determinants for neutralizing antibody recognition, antigenic
                  conservation, and RBD conformation. The in-depth escape maps
                  may have value for prospective surveillance of SARS-CoV-2
                  immune escape variants. Special attention should be paid to
                  the accumulation of co-mutations at distinct major antigenic
                  sites. Finally, the new broadly reactive NAbs described here
                  represent new potential opportunities for the prevention and
                  treatment of COVID-19.},

                  myriad of mammalian hosts, such as humans, cats, bats, civets,
                  dogs, and camels with varied consequences in terms of death
                  and debilitation. Strikingly, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),
                  later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome
                  coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and found to be the causative
                  agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), shows 88\% of
                  sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21,
                  79\% with SARS-CoV and 50\% with MERS-CoV, respectively.
                  Despite key amino acid residual variability, there is an
                  incredible structural similarity between the receptor binding
                  domain (RBD) of spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
                  During infection, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to
                  SARS-CoV displays 10-20 times greater affinity for its cognate
                  host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
                  leading proteolytic cleavage of S protein by transmembrane
                  protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Following cellular entry, the
                  ORF-1a and ORF-1ab, located downstream to 5' end of + ssRNA
                  genome, undergo translation, thereby forming two large
                  polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins, following
                  protease-induced cleavage and molecular assembly, form
                  functional viral RNA polymerase, also referred to as
                  replicase. Thereafter, uninterrupted orchestrated
                  replication-transcription molecular events lead to the
                  synthesis of multiple nested sets of subgenomic mRNAs
                  (sgRNAs), which are finally translated to several structural
                  and accessory proteins participating in structure formation

                  screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that antagonize type
                  I interferon (IFN-I) response. We found three proteins that

                  nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) binds TANK binding kinase 1
                  (TBK1) to suppress interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)
                  phosphorylation, nsp13 binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation,
                  and open reading frame 6 (ORF6) binds importin Karyopherin Î± 2
                  (KPNA2) to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation. We identify two

                  blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription 1

                  terminal tandem repeat regions in the monkeypox virus genome
                  and corrects a common misassembly in published sequences.
                  Besides, several intra-host single nucleotide variations were
                  identified in the first imported mpox case. This study offers
                  an evaluation of various strategies aimed at identifying the
                  complete genome of MPXV in clinical specimens. The findings of
                  this study will significantly enhance the surveillance of
                  MPXV.},

                  syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat
                  to public health1-3. Despite intense research efforts, how,
                  when and where new diseases appear are still a source of
                  considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was
                  recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25
                  January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the
                  first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019.
                  Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the
                  outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here
                  we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and
                  who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26
                  December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome
                  that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA
                  sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from
                  the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family
                  Coronaviridae, which is designated here 'WH-Human 1'
                  coronavirus (and has also been referred to as '2019-nCoV').
                  Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903
                  nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related
                  (89.1\% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like
                  coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus)
                  that had previously been found in bats in China5. This
                  outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over
                  from animals to cause severe disease in humans.}

                  closely related bat virus, RaTG13. We determined cryo-EM

                  uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S; we compared these with recently
                  reported structures for uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S. We also
                  biochemically characterized their relative stabilities and
                  affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Although the
                  overall structures of human and bat virus S proteins are
                  similar, there are key differences in their properties,
                  including a more stable precleavage form of human S and about
                  1,000-fold tighter binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human receptor.
                  These observations suggest that cleavage at the furin-cleavage
                  site decreases the overall stability of SARS-CoV-2 S and
                  facilitates the adoption of the open conformation that is

                  of concern (VOCs) threaten this strategy. Omicron (B.1.1.529),
                  the fifth VOC to be described, harbours multiple amino acid

                  substantial reduction in real-world vaccine effectiveness that
                  was partially restored by booster vaccination. The Omicron
                  variants BA.1 and BA.2 did not induce cell syncytia in vitro

                  surged notably to become dominant in the United States and
                  South Africa, respectively1,2. These new subvariants carrying
                  further mutations in their spike proteins raise concerns that
                  they may further evade neutralizing antibodies, thereby
                  further compromising the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and
                  therapeutic monoclonals. We now report findings from a
                  systematic antigenic analysis of these surging Omicron
                  subvariants. BA.2.12.1 is only modestly (1.8-fold) more
                  resistant to sera from vaccinated and boosted individuals than
                  BA.2. However, BA.4/5 is substantially (4.2-fold) more
                  resistant and thus more likely to lead to vaccine breakthrough
                  infections. Mutation at spike residue L452 found in both
                  BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 facilitates escape from some antibodies
                  directed to the so-called class 2 and 3 regions of the
                  receptor-binding domain3. The F486V mutation found in BA.4/5
                  facilitates escape from certain class 1 and 2 antibodies but
                  compromises the spike affinity for the viral receptor. The
                  R493Q reversion mutation, however, restores receptor affinity
                  and consequently the fitness of BA.4/5. Among therapeutic
                  antibodies authorized for clinical use, only bebtelovimab
                  retains full potency against both BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5. The
                  Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve,
                  successively yielding subvariants that are not only more
                  transmissible but also more evasive to antibodies.}

  abstract     = {The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has
                  led to more than 200 million infections and over 4 million
                  deaths worldwide. The progress in the developments of
                  effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics
                  brings hopes to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. However,
                  SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have
                  been emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations,
                  the E484K mutation shared by many variants attracted serious
                  concerns, which may potentially enhance the receptor binding
                  affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study,
                  the molecular mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation
                  on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
                  with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
                  (hACE2) was investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD)
                  simulations combined with the molecular mechanics-generalized
                  Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that
                  the E484K mutation results in more favorable electrostatic
                  interactions compensating the burial of the charged and polar
                  groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly
                  improves the RBD-hACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the
                  E484K mutation also causes the conformational rearrangements
                  of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads
                  to tighter binding interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation
                  of some new hydrogen bonds. The tighter binding interface and
                  the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the
                  improved binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2. In
                  addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed
                  with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K
                  mutation on the recognition of these antibodies to RBD. The
                  simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly
                  reduces the binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied
                  neutralizing antibodies/nanobodies, and the decrease in the
                  binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable
                  electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation. Our studies
                  revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding
                  affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more
                  transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants, and weaken
                  the binding affinities between RBD and the studied
                  neutralizing antibodies/nanobodies, indicating reduced
                  effectiveness of these antibodies/nanobodies. Our results
                  provide valuable information for the effective vaccine
                  development and antibody/nanobody drug design.},

                  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the immunogenicity of
                  spike protein-based antigens remains unknown. When immunized
                  in mice, the S1 domain induced much higher IgG and IgA
                  antibody levels than the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and
                  more efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 when adjuvanted with
                  alum. It is inferred that a large proportion of these
                  neutralization epitopes are located in the S1 domain but
                  outside the RBD and that some of these are spatial epitopes.
                  This finding indicates that expression systems with
                  posttranslational modification abilities are important to
                  maintain the natural configurations of recombinant spike
                  protein antigens and are critical for effective COVID-19
                  vaccines. Further, adjuvants prone to a Th1 response should be
                  considered for S1-based subunit COVID-19 vaccines to reduce
                  the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of
                  infection.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from
                  Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those
                  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
                  (SARS-CoV). Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive
                  structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level
                  interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein
                  receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor
                  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both
                  the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of
                  SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by
                  2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the
                  newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of
                  2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that
                  directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV,
                  strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor.
                  Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM
                  (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with
                  human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human
                  cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in
                  2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but
                  not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV
                  has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission.
                  Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of
                  2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a
                  diversity of animal species (except mice and rats),
                  implicating these animal species as possible intermediate
                  hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These
                  analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry,
                  host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may
                  help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against
                  2019-nCoV.IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus
                  (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent
                  of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long
                  structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV
                  have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike
                  protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
                  (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and
                  human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of
                  SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative
                  framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate
                  epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor
                  usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models
                  of viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein,
                  we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights
                  into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.
                  This study provides a robust test of this reiterative
                  framework, providing the basic, translational, and public
                  health research communities with predictive insights that may
                  help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.},

                  receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind
                  with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the
                  efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the

  abstract     = {The concept of âoriginal antigenic sinâ was first proposed by
                  Thomas Francis, Jr. in 1960. This phenomenon has the potential
                  to rewrite what we understand about how the immune system
                  responds to infections and its mechanistic implications on how
                  vaccines should be designed. Antigenic sin has been
                  demonstrated to occur in several infectious diseases in both
                  animals and humans, including human influenza infection and
                  dengue fever. The basis of âoriginal antigenic sinâ requires
                  immunological memory, and our immune system ability to
                  autocorrect. In the context of viral infections, it is
                  expected that if we are exposed to a native strain of a
                  pathogen, we should be able to mount a secondary immune
                  response on subsequent exposure to the same pathogen.
                  âOriginal antigenic sinâ will not contradict this
                  well-established immunological process, as long as the
                  subsequent infectious antigen is identical to the original
                  one. But âoriginal antigenic sinâ implies that when the
                  epitope varies slightly, then the immune system relies on
                  memory of the earlier infection, rather than mount another
                  primary or secondary response to the new epitope which would
                  allow faster and stronger responses. The result is that the
                  immunological response may be inadequate against the new
                  strain, because the immune system does not adapt and instead
                  relies on its memory to mount a response. In the case of
                  vaccines, if we only immunize to a single strain or epitope,
                  and if that strain/epitope changes over time, then the immune
                  system is unable to mount an accurate secondary response. In
                  addition, depending of the first viral exposure the secondary
                  immune response can result in an antibody-dependent
                  enhancement of the disease or at the opposite, it could induce
                  anergy. Both of them triggering loss of pathogen control and
                  inducing aberrant clinical consequences.},

                  noncovalent, nonpeptidic SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibitor
                  clinical candidate. S-217622 was discovered via virtual
                  screening followed by biological screening of an in-house
                  compound library, and optimization of the hit compound using a
                  structure-based drug design strategy. S-217622 exhibited
                  antiviral activity in vitro against current outbreaking
                  SARS-CoV-2 variants and showed favorable pharmacokinetic
                  profiles in vivo for once-daily oral dosing. Furthermore,
                  S-217622 dose-dependently inhibited intrapulmonary replication
                  of SARS-CoV-2 in mice, indicating that this novel noncovalent
                  inhibitor could be a potential oral agent for treating
                  COVID-19.}

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant was first
                  detected in England in March, 2021. It has since rapidly
                  become the predominant lineage, owing to high
                  transmissibility. It is suspected that the delta variant is
                  associated with more severe disease than the previously
                  dominant alpha (B.1.1.7) variant. We aimed to characterise the
                  severity of the delta variant compared with the alpha variant
                  by determining the relative risk of hospital attendance
                  outcomes. METHODS: This cohort study was done among all
                  patients with COVID-19 in England between March 29 and May 23,
                  2021, who were identified as being infected with either the
                  alpha or delta SARS-CoV-2 variant through whole-genome
                  sequencing. Individual-level data on these patients were
                  linked to routine health-care datasets on vaccination,
                  emergency care attendance, hospital admission, and mortality
                  (data from Public Health England's Second Generation
                  Surveillance System and COVID-19-associated deaths dataset;
                  the National Immunisation Management System; and NHS Digital
                  Secondary Uses Services and Emergency Care Data Set). The risk
                  for hospital admission and emergency care attendance were
                  compared between patients with sequencing-confirmed delta and
                  alpha variants for the whole cohort and by vaccination status
                  subgroups. Stratified Cox regression was used to adjust for
                  age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, recent international travel,
                  area of residence, calendar week, and vaccination status.
                  FINDINGS: Individual-level data on 43 338 COVID-19-positive
                  patients (8682 with the delta variant, 34 656 with the alpha
                  variant; median age 31 years [IQR 17-43]) were included in our
                  analysis. 196 (2Â·3\%) patients with the delta variant versus
                  764 (2Â·2\%) patients with the alpha variant were admitted to
                  hospital within 14 days after the specimen was taken (adjusted
                  hazard ratio [HR] 2Â·26 [95\% CI 1Â·32-3Â·89]). 498 (5Â·7\%)
                  patients with the delta variant versus 1448 (4Â·2\%) patients
                  with the alpha variant were admitted to hospital or attended
                  emergency care within 14 days (adjusted HR 1Â·45 [1Â·08-1Â·95]).
                  Most patients were unvaccinated (32 078 [74Â·0\%] across both
                  groups). The HRs for vaccinated patients with the delta
                  variant versus the alpha variant (adjusted HR for hospital
                  admission 1Â·94 [95\% CI 0Â·47-8Â·05] and for hospital admission
                  or emergency care attendance 1Â·58 [0Â·69-3Â·61]) were similar to
                  the HRs for unvaccinated patients (2Â·32 [1Â·29-4Â·16] and 1Â·43
                  [1Â·04-1Â·97]; p=0Â·82 for both) but the precision for the
                  vaccinated subgroup was low. INTERPRETATION: This large
                  national study found a higher hospital admission or emergency
                  care attendance risk for patients with COVID-19 infected with
                  the delta variant compared with the alpha variant. Results
                  suggest that outbreaks of the delta variant in unvaccinated
                  populations might lead to a greater burden on health-care
                  services than the alpha variant. FUNDING: Medical Research

  abstract     = {SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading around the world for the past
                  year. Recently, several variants such as B.1.1.7 (alpha),
                  B.1.351 (beta), and P.1 (gamma), which share a key mutation
                  N501Y on the receptor-binding domain (RBD), appear to be more
                  infectious to humans. To understand the underlying mechanism,
                  we used a cell surface-binding assay, a kinetics study, a
                  single-molecule technique, and a computational method to
                  investigate the interaction between these RBD (mutations) and
                  ACE2. Remarkably, RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a
                  considerably stronger interaction, with a faster association
                  rate and a slower dissociation rate. Atomic force microscopy
                  (AFM)-based single-molecule force microscopy (SMFS)
                  consistently quantified the interaction strength of RBD with
                  the mutation as having increased binding probability and
                  requiring increased unbinding force. Molecular dynamics
                  simulations of RBD-ACE2 complexes indicated that the N501Y
                  mutation introduced additional Ï-Ï and Ï-cation interactions
                  that could explain the changes observed by force microscopy.
                  Taken together, these results suggest that the reinforced
                  RBD-ACE2 interaction that results from the N501Y mutation in
                  the RBD should play an essential role in the higher rate of
                  transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that future mutations
                  in the RBD of the virus should be under surveillance.},

                  arisen lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (designated 501Y.V2; also known
                  as B.1.351 or 20H) that is defined by eight mutations in the
                  spike protein, including three substitutions (K417N, E484K and
                  N501Y) at residues in its receptor-binding domain that may
                  have functional importance3-5. This lineage was identified in
                  South Africa after the first wave of the epidemic in a
                  severely affected metropolitan area (Nelson Mandela Bay) that
                  is located on the coast of the Eastern Cape province. This
                  lineage spread rapidly, and became dominant in Eastern Cape,
                  Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces within weeks.
                  Although the full import of the mutations is yet to be
                  determined, the genomic data-which show rapid expansion and
                  displacement of other lineages in several regions-suggest that
                  this lineage is associated with a selection advantage that
                  most plausibly results from increased transmissibility or

                  notably, those developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli
                  Lilly and Company have proven to provide protection against
                  severe COVID-19. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with
                  heavily mutated spike proteins raises the concern that the
                  therapy could become less effective if any of the mutations
                  disrupt epitopes engaged by the antibodies. In this study, we
                  tested monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987 that are
                  used in combination, for their ability to neutralize
                  SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, mink cluster 5 and
                  COH.20G/677H. We report that REGN10987 maintains most of its
                  neutralization activity against viruses with B.1.1.7, B.1.351
                  and mink cluster 5 spike proteins but that REGN10933 has lost
                  activity against B.1.351 and mink cluster 5. The failure of
                  REGN10933 to neutralize B.1.351 is caused by the K417N and
                  E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain; the failure to
                  neutralize the mink cluster 5 spike protein is caused by the
                  Y453F mutation. The REGN10933 and REGN10987 combination was
                  9.1-fold less potent on B.1.351 and 16.2-fold less potent on
                  mink cluster 5, raising concerns of reduced efficacy in the
                  treatment of patients infected with variant viruses. The
                  results suggest that there is a need to develop additional
                  monoclonal antibodies that are not affected by the current
                  spike protein mutations.}

                  receptor-binding domain (RBD) that impact ACE2 receptor
                  binding, folding stability, and antibody recognition. Deep
                  mutational scanning prospectively characterizes the impacts of
                  mutations on these biochemical properties, enabling rapid
                  assessment of new mutations seen during viral surveillance.
                  However, the effects of mutations can change as the virus
                  evolves, requiring updated deep mutational scans. We
                  determined the impacts of all single amino acid mutations in
                  the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 RBDs on ACE2-binding affinity, RBD
                  folding, and escape from binding by the LY-CoV1404
                  (bebtelovimab) monoclonal antibody. The effects of some
                  mutations in Omicron RBDs differ from those measured in the
                  ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 background. These epistatic shifts
                  largely resemble those previously seen in the Alpha variant
                  due to the convergent epistatically modifying N501Y
                  substitution. However, Omicron variants show additional
                  lineage-specific shifts, including examples of the epistatic
                  phenomenon of entrenchment that causes the Q498R and N501Y
                  substitutions present in Omicron to be more favorable in that
                  background than in earlier viral strains. In contrast, the
                  Omicron substitution Q493R exhibits no sign of entrenchment,
                  with the derived state, R493, being as unfavorable for ACE2
                  binding in Omicron RBDs as in Wuhan-Hu-1. Likely for this
                  reason, the R493Q reversion has occurred in Omicron
                  sub-variants including BA.4/BA.5 and BA.2.75, where the
                  affinity buffer from R493Q reversion may potentiate concurrent
                  antigenic change. Consistent with prior studies, we find that
                  Omicron RBDs have reduced expression, and identify candidate
                  stabilizing mutations that ameliorate this deficit. Last, our
                  maps highlight a broadening of the sites of escape from
                  LY-CoV1404 antibody binding in BA.1 and BA.2 compared to the
                  ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 background. These BA.1 and BA.2 deep
                  mutational scanning datasets identify shifts in the RBD
                  mutational landscape and inform ongoing efforts in viral
                  surveillance.}

                  (N501Y), cause epistatic shifts in the effects of mutations at
                  other sites. These epistatic shifts shape subsequent
                  evolutionary change-for example, enabling many of the
                  antibody-escape substitutions in the Omicron RBD. These
                  epistatic shifts occur despite high conservation of the

                  physical and genetic interactions among amino acids. Recent
                  studies have used new strategies to explore the prevalence,
                  biochemical mechanisms, and evolutionary implications of these
                  interactions-called epistasis-within proteins. Here we
                  describe an emerging picture of pervasive epistasis in which
                  the physical and biological effects of mutations change over
                  the course of evolution in a lineage-specific fashion.
                  Epistasis can restrict the trajectories available to an
                  evolving protein or open new paths to sequences and functions
                  that would otherwise have been inaccessible. We describe two
                  broad classes of epistatic interactions, which arise from
                  different physical mechanisms and have different effects on
                  evolutionary processes. Specific epistasis-in which one
                  mutation influences the phenotypic effect of few other
                  mutations-is caused by direct and indirect physical
                  interactions between mutations, which nonadditively change the
                  protein's physical properties, such as conformation,
                  stability, or affinity for ligands. In contrast, nonspecific
                  epistasis describes mutations that modify the effect of many
                  others; these typically behave additively with respect to the
                  physical properties of a protein but exhibit epistasis because
                  of a nonlinear relationship between the physical properties
                  and their biological effects, such as function or fitness.
                  Both types of interaction are rampant, but specific epistasis
                  has stronger effects on the rate and outcomes of evolution,
                  because it imposes stricter constraints and modulates
                  evolutionary potential more dramatically; it therefore makes
                  evolution more contingent on low-probability historical events
                  and leaves stronger marks on the sequences, structures, and
                  functions of protein families.},

                  promoting TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3)-mediated
                  ubiquitination of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
                  containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC). SARS-CoV and

                  pro-IL-1Î² gene transcription and protein maturation, the 2
                  signals required for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
                  ORF3a induced pro-IL-1Î² transcription through activation of
                  NF-ÎºB, which was mediated by TRAF3-dependent ubiquitination
                  and processing of p105. ORF3a-induced elevation of IL-1Î²
                  secretion was independent of its ion channel activity or

                  greater genetic diversity than obtainable by mutation alone.
                  The above-mentioned properties allow for the rapid evolution
                  of RNA viruses, which may result in difficulties in viral
                  eradication, changes in virulence and pathogenicity, and lead

                  November 2021 and is rapidly spreading among the human
                  population1. Although recent reports reveal that the Omicron
                  variant robustly escapes vaccine-associated and therapeutic
                  neutralization antibodies2-10, the pathogenicity of the virus
                  remains unknown. Here we show that the replication of Omicron
                  is substantially attenuated in human Calu3 and Caco2 cells.
                  Further mechanistic investigations reveal that Omicron is
                  inefficient in its use of transmembrane serine protease 2
                  (TMPRSS2) compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-001a) and
                  previous variants, which may explain its reduced replication
                  in Calu3 and Caco2 cells. The replication of Omicron is
                  markedly attenuated in both the upper and lower respiratory
                  tracts of infected K18-hACE2 mice compared with that of the
                  wild-type strain and Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, resulting in
                  its substantially ameliorated lung pathology. Compared with
                  wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (1.351) and
                  Delta variants, infection by Omicron causes the lowest
                  reduction in body weight and the lowest mortality rate.
                  Overall, our study demonstrates that the replication and
                  pathogenicity of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in mice is
                  attenuated compared with the wild-type strain and other
                  variants.}

                  important to monitor the mutations that arise in the
                  SARS-CoV-2 virus, to prepare public health strategies and
                  guide the further development of vaccines and therapeutics.
                  The spike (S) protein and the proteins comprising the
                  RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) are key vaccine and drug
                  targets, respectively, making mutation surveillance of these
                  proteins of great importance. Full protein sequences were
                  downloaded from the GISAID database, aligned, and the variants
                  identified. 437,006 unique viral genomes were analyzed.
                  Polymorphisms in the protein sequence were investigated and
                  examined longitudinally to identify sequence and strain
                  variants appearing between January 5th, 2020 and January 16th,
                  2021. A structural analysis was also performed to investigate
                  mutations in the receptor binding domain and the N-terminal
                  domain of the spike protein. Within the spike protein, there
                  were 766 unique mutations observed in the N-terminal domain
                  and 360 in the receptor binding domain. Four residues that
                  directly contact ACE2 were mutated in more than 100 sequences,
                  including positions K417, Y453, S494, and N501. Within the
                  furin cleavage site of the spike protein, a high degree of
                  conservation was observed, but the P681H mutation was observed
                  in 10.47\% of sequences analyzed. Within the RNA dependent RNA
                  polymerase complex proteins, 327 unique mutations were
                  observed in Nsp8, 166 unique mutations were observed in Nsp7,
                  and 1157 unique mutations were observed in Nsp12. Only 4
                  sequences analyzed contained mutations in the 9 residues that
                  directly interact with the therapeutic Remdesivir, suggesting
                  limited mutations in drug interacting residues. The
                  identification of new variants emphasizes the need for further
                  study on the effects of the mutations and the implications of
                  increased prevalence, particularly for vaccine or therapeutic
                  efficacy.},

                  there is a growing need for analysis tools that are not just
                  performant but also comprehensive and user-friendly enough to
                  cater to both novice and advanced users. This article
                  introduces SeqKit2, the next iteration of the widely used
                  sequence analysis tool SeqKit, featuring expanded
                  functionality, performance optimizations, and support for
                  additional compression methods. Retaining a pragmatic
                  subcommand architecture, SeqKit2 represents substantial
                  enhancement through the inclusion of 19 additional
                  subcommands, expanding its overall repertoire to a total of 38
                  in eight categories. The new subcommands add functionality
                  such as amplicon processing and robust, error-tolerant parsing
                  of sequence records. In addition, three subcommands designed
                  for real-time analysis are added for periodic monitoring of
                  properties of FASTQ and Binary Alignment/Map alignment records
                  and real-time streaming from multiple sequence files. The
                  performance of SeqKit2 is benchmarked against the old version
                  of SeqKit, Bioawk, Seqtk, and SeqFu tools. SeqKit2
                  consistently outperforms its predecessor, albeit with
                  marginally higher memory usage, while maintaining competitive
                  runtimes against other tools. With its broad functionality,
                  proven usability, and ongoing development driven by user
                  feedback, we hope that bioinformaticians will find SeqKit2
                  useful as a âSwiss army knifeâ of sequence and alignment
                  processing-equally adept at facilitating ad hoc analyses and
                  seamlessly integrating into larger pipelines.},

                  molecular basis of the antiviral actions of interferons
                  (IFNs), as well as strategies evolved by viruses to antagonize
                  the actions of IFNs. Furthermore, advances made while
                  elucidating the IFN system have contributed significantly to
                  our understanding in multiple areas of virology and molecular
                  cell biology, ranging from pathways of signal transduction to
                  the biochemical mechanisms of transcriptional and
                  translational control to the molecular basis of viral
                  pathogenesis. IFNs are approved therapeutics and have moved
                  from the basic research laboratory to the clinic. Among the
                  IFN-induced proteins important in the antiviral actions of
                  IFNs are the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), the
                  2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L, and the Mx
                  protein GTPases. Double-stranded RNA plays a central role in
                  modulating protein phosphorylation and RNA degradation
                  catalyzed by the IFN-inducible PKR kinase and the
                  2'-5'-oligoadenylate-dependent RNase L, respectively, and also
                  in RNA editing by the IFN-inducible RNA-specific adenosine
                  deaminase (ADAR1). IFN also induces a form of inducible nitric
                  oxide synthase (iNOS2) and the major histocompatibility
                  complex class I and II proteins, all of which play important
                  roles in immune response to infections. Several additional
                  genes whose expression profiles are altered in response to IFN
                  treatment and virus infection have been identified by
                  microarray analyses. The availability of cDNA and genomic
                  clones for many of the components of the IFN system, including
                  IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma, their receptors, Jak and
                  Stat and IRF signal transduction components, and proteins such
                  as PKR, 2',5'-OAS, Mx, and ADAR, whose expression is regulated
                  by IFNs, has permitted the generation of mutant proteins,
                  cells that overexpress different forms of the proteins, and
                  animals in which their expression has been disrupted by
                  targeted gene disruption. The use of these IFN system
                  reagents, both in cell culture and in whole animals, continues
                  to provide important contributions to our understanding of the
                  virus-host interaction and cellular antiviral response.}

                  concern are considered to be potentially hazardous to human

                  occurred in India in the spring of 2021 (ref. 2). However, the
                  virological properties of B.1.617.2/Delta remain unclear. Here
                  we show that the B.1.617.2/Delta variant is highly fusogenic
                  and notably more pathogenic than prototypic SARS-CoV-2 in
                  infected hamsters. The P681R mutation in the spike protein,
                  which is highly conserved in this lineage, facilitates
                  cleavage of the spike protein and enhances viral fusogenicity.
                  Moreover, we demonstrate that the P681R-bearing virus exhibits
                  higher pathogenicity compared with its parental virus. Our
                  data suggest that the P681R mutation is a hallmark of the

                  respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome
                  (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These viruses

                  replication strategy. Coronavirus have the largest RNA genomes
                  ( 26-32 kilobases) and their expansion was likely enabled by
                  acquiring enzyme functions that counter the commonly high
                  error frequency of viral RNA polymerases. Non-structural

                  special mRNA capping (nsp 14, nsp 16) and fidelity regulation

                  Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19
                  prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum
                  hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was
                  validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic
                  Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure
                  resulted in average recoveries of 10 Â± 3.5\% and 10 Â± 2.1\% in
                  influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 Â± 1.6\% and 6.2 Â± 1.0\% in
                  effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively.
                  Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of
                  SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent,
                  secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the
                  real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US
                  CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N)
                  gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in
                  untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 Â± 0.2 log10 genomic
                  copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted
                  positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested
                  as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data
                  were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality
                  level, revealing that members of the community were shedding
                  SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were
                  reported by local or national authorities in many of the
                  cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of
                  SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of
                  COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early
                  indicator of the infection within a specific population. At
                  this point, this environmental surveillance could be
                  implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed
                  to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to
                  gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.},

                  contribute most to active spread. Our system is made tractable

                  this nomenclature will assist in tracking and understanding

                  into membranes, ending in postfusion trimers. Class III

                  November 2021 in Botswana and South Africa1-3. It has since
                  spread to many countries and is expected to rapidly become
                  dominant worldwide. The lineage is characterized by the
                  presence of around 32 mutations in spike-located mostly in the
                  N-terminal domain and the receptor-binding domain-that may
                  enhance viral fitness and enable antibody evasion. Here we
                  isolated an infectious Omicron virus in Belgium from a
                  traveller returning from Egypt. We examined its sensitivity to
                  nine monoclonal antibodies that have been clinically approved
                  or are in development4, and to antibodies present in 115 serum
                  samples from COVID-19 vaccine recipients or individuals who
                  have recovered from COVID-19. Omicron was completely or
                  partially resistant to neutralization by all monoclonal
                  antibodies tested. Sera from recipients of the Pfizer or
                  AstraZeneca vaccine, sampled five months after complete
                  vaccination, barely inhibited Omicron. Sera from
                  COVID-19-convalescent patients collected 6 or 12 months after
                  symptoms displayed low or no neutralizing activity against
                  Omicron. Administration of a booster Pfizer dose as well as
                  vaccination of previously infected individuals generated an
                  anti-Omicron neutralizing response, with titres 6-fold to
                  23-fold lower against Omicron compared with those against
                  Delta. Thus, Omicron escapes most therapeutic monoclonal
                  antibodies and, to a large extent, vaccine-elicited
                  antibodies. However, Omicron is neutralized by antibodies
                  generated by a booster vaccine dose.}

                  RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and suggests a mechanism of

                  binding domain (RBD) compared with the ancestral BA.2.86,

                  define at the molecular level the JN.1 ability to spread
                  globally, we interrogated a panel of 899 neutralizing human

                  unleashed the global spread of JN.1, likely occurring by
                  elimination of more than 70\% of the neutralizing antibodies
                  mediated by IGHV3-53/3-66 germlines. However, the resilience
                  of class 3 antibodies with low neutralization potency but

                  (MPXV) proteome. We reconstructed full single-point mutational
                  landscapes of 171 MPXV proteins using two advanced mutational
                  effect predictors, ESCOTT and iGEMME, selected for their
                  superior performance on viral proteins, assessed by
                  benchmarking against the experimental data in the ProteinGym
                  (v1.0.0) dataset. A recent MPXV strain sequenced in July 2024
                  was used as the reference genome. Multiple sequence alignments
                  and protein structures were generated using Colabfold v1.5.5,
                  and the predicted structures were evaluated with pLDDT metric,
                  secondary structure predictions, and comparisons with
                  available experimental data, ensuring high confidence in the
                  structural models. To prioritize the most mutation-sensitive
                  proteins within the large MPXV proteome as prime candidates
                  for drug or vaccine development, we introduced a novel,
                  interpretable metric: Average Gene Mutation Sensitivity
                  (AGMS). Among the top 20 identified proteins, several were
                  membrane-associated proteins, expected to be important for
                  viral interactions with the hosts. This analysis provides a
                  valuable resource for assessing the impact of new MPXV
                  variants and guiding therapeutic strategies. This pioneering
                  study underscores the significance of understanding MPXV
                  evolution in the context of the ongoing global health crisis
                  and offers a robust computational framework to support this

                  data management principles, NCBI Datasets offers user-friendly
                  web interfaces, command-line tools, and documented APIs,
                  empowering researchers to access NCBI data seamlessly. The

  abstract     = {Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 tend to have
                  high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which eventually
                  lead to cytokine storm and the development of acute
                  respiratory distress syndrome. However, the detailed molecular
                  mechanisms of proinflammatory cytokine production remain
                  unknown. Here, we screened severe acute respiratory syndrome
                  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genes and found that nonstructural
                  protein 6 (NSP6) and open reading frame 7a (ORF7a) activated
                  the NF-ÎºB pathway. NSP6 and ORF7a interacted with transforming
                  growth factor Î²-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and knockout (KO)
                  of TAK1 or NF-ÎºB essential modulator (NEMO) abolished NF-ÎºB
                  activation by NSP6 and ORF7a. Interestingly, K61 of NSP6 was
                  conjugated to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the E3
                  ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing 13, and this
                  polyubiquitination of NSP6 appeared crucial for recruitment of
                  NEMO to the NSP6-TAK1 complex and NF-ÎºB activation. On the
                  other hand, ring finger protein 121 (RNF121) was required for
                  the polyubiquitination of ORF7a. Knockdown of RNF121
                  significantly decreased ORF7a binding of TAK1 and NEMO,
                  resulting in the suppression of NF-ÎºB activation. Taken
                  together, our results provide novel molecular insights into
                  the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune response to
                  SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE The detailed molecular basis
                  of the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines
                  by SARS-CoV-2 is unclear, although such induction is clearly
                  related to the severity of COVID-19. Here, we show that
                  SARS-CoV-2 NSP6 and ORF7a lead to NF-ÎºB activation through
                  associations with TAK1. K63-linked polyubiquitination of NSP6
                  and ORF7a by TRIM13 and RNF121, respectively, appears
                  essential for NF-ÎºB activation. These results suggest that
                  inhibition of the NSP6 and ORF7a gene products may reduce the
                  severity of COVID-19 symptoms by decreasing proinflammatory
                  cytokine levels.},

                  membrane curvature is regulated by one M conformer. Elongated
                  M protein is associated with rigidity, clusters of spikes and
                  a relatively narrow range of membrane curvature. In contrast,

  abstract     = {The sudden emergence of severe respiratory disease, caused by
                  a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
                  (SARS-CoV-2), has recently become a public health emergency.
                  Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed its close
                  resemblance to the earlier reported SARS-CoV and Middle East
                  respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, initial
                  testing of the drugs used against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has
                  been ineffective in controlling SARS-CoV-2. The present study
                  highlights the genomic, proteomic, pathogenesis, and
                  therapeutic strategies in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have
                  carried out sequence analysis of potential drug target
                  proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and, compared them with SARS-CoV and
                  MERS viruses. Analysis of mutations in the coding and
                  non-coding regions, genetic diversity, and pathogenicity of
                  SARS-CoV-2 has also been done. A detailed structural analysis
                  of drug target proteins has been performed to gain insights
                  into the mechanism of pathogenesis, structure-function
                  relationships, and the development of structure-guided
                  therapeutic approaches. The cytokine profiling and
                  inflammatory signalling are different in the case of
                  SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also highlighted possible therapies
                  and their mechanism of action followed by clinical
                  manifestation. Our analysis suggests a minimal variation in
                  the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, may be responsible for a
                  drastic change in the structures of target proteins, which
                  makes available drugs ineffective.},

                  have emerged. These mutations can affect viral properties such
                  as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity
                  of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity
                  has been investigated, sensitivity to human leukocyte antigen
                  (HLA)-restricted cellular immunity remains largely unexplored.
                  Here, we demonstrate that two recently emerging mutations in
                  the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
                  L452R (in B.1.427/429 and B.1.617) and Y453F (in B.1.1.298),
                  confer escape from HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity. These
                  mutations reinforce affinity toward the host entry receptor
                  ACE2. Notably, the L452R mutation increases spike stability,
                  viral infectivity, viral fusogenicity, and thereby promotes
                  viral replication. These data suggest that HLA-restricted
                  cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral
                  phenotypes and that a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2
                  pandemic is escape from cellular immunity.},

                  IIb descendant of a monkeypox virus (MPXV) lineage traced back
                  to Nigeria in 1971. Person-to-person transmission appears
                  higher than for clade I or subclade IIa MPXV, possibly caused
                  by genomic changes in subclade IIb MPXV. Key genomic changes
                  could occur in the genome's low-complexity regions (LCRs),
                  which are challenging to sequence and are often dismissed as
                  uninformative. Here, using a combination of highly sensitive
                  techniques, we determine a high-quality MPXV genome sequence
                  of a representative of the current epidemic with LCRs resolved
                  at unprecedented accuracy. This reveals significant variation
                  in short tandem repeats within LCRs. We demonstrate that LCR
                  entropy in the MPXV genome is significantly higher than that
                  of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and that LCRs are
                  not randomly distributed. In silico analyses indicate that
                  expression, translation, stability, or function of MPXV
                  orthologous poxvirus genes (OPGs), including OPG153, OPG204,
                  and OPG208, could be affected in a manner consistent with the
                  established âgenomic accordionâ evolutionary strategies of
                  orthopoxviruses. We posit that genomic studies focusing on
                  phenotypic MPXV differences should consider LCR variability.}

                  respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed a
                  significant threat to global health. This virus affects the
                  respiratory tract and usually leads to pneumonia in most
                  patients and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in
                  15\% of cases. ARDS is one of the leading causes of death in
                  patients with COVID-19 and is mainly triggered by elevated
                  levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, referred to as cytokine
                  storm. Interleukins, such as interleukin-6 (1L-6),
                  interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and tumor
                  necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) play a very significant role in
                  lung damage in ARDS patients through the impairments of the
                  respiratory epithelium. Cytokine storm is defined as acute
                  overproduction and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory
                  markers, both locally and systemically. The eradication of
                  COVID-19 is currently practically impossible, and there is no
                  specific treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19;
                  however, suppressing the inflammatory response may be a
                  possible strategy. In light of this, we review the efficacy of
                  specific inhibitors of IL6, IL1, IL-17, and TNF-Î± for treating
                  COVID-19-related infections to manage COVID-19 and improve the

                  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in
                  the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and spread throughout
                  India, outcompeting pre-existing lineages including B.1.617.1
                  (Kappa) and B.1.1.7 (Alpha)1. In vitro, B.1.617.2 is sixfold
                  less sensitive to serum neutralizing antibodies from recovered
                  individuals, and eightfold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited
                  antibodies, compared with wild-type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G.
                  Serum neutralizing titres against B.1.617.2 were lower in
                  ChAdOx1 vaccinees than in BNT162b2 vaccinees. B.1.617.2 spike
                  pseudotyped viruses exhibited compromised sensitivity to
                  monoclonal antibodies to the receptor-binding domain and the
                  amino-terminal domain. B.1.617.2 demonstrated higher
                  replication efficiency than B.1.1.7 in both airway organoid
                  and human airway epithelial systems, associated with B.1.617.2
                  spike being in a predominantly cleaved state compared with
                  B.1.1.7 spike. The B.1.617.2 spike protein was able to mediate
                  highly efficient syncytium formation that was less sensitive
                  to inhibition by neutralizing antibody, compared with that of
                  wild-type spike. We also observed that B.1.617.2 had higher
                  replication and spike-mediated entry than B.1.617.1,
                  potentially explaining the B.1.617.2 dominance. In an analysis
                  of more than 130 SARS-CoV-2-infected health care workers
                  across three centres in India during a period of mixed lineage
                  circulation, we observed reduced ChAdOx1 vaccine effectiveness
                  against B.1.617.2 relative to non-B.1.617.2, with the caveat
                  of possible residual confounding. Compromised vaccine efficacy
                  against the highly fit and immune-evasive B.1.617.2 Delta
                  variant warrants continued infection control measures in the

                  2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. The latest pandemic united
                  scientific community and served as a powerful impetus in the
                  study of biology of coronaviruses: new routes of virus

  abstract     = {The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in 20211 and has
                  multiple mutations in its spike protein2. Here we show that
                  the spike protein of Omicron has a higher affinity for ACE2
                  compared with Delta, and a marked change in its antigenicity
                  increases Omicron's evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and
                  vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralizing antibodies after two
                  doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and
                  broadens neutralization. Importantly, the antiviral drugs
                  remdesivir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron
                  BA.1. Replication was similar for Omicron and Delta virus
                  isolates in human nasal epithelial cultures. However, in lung
                  cells and gut cells, Omicron demonstrated lower replication.
                  Omicron spike protein was less efficiently cleaved compared
                  with Delta. The differences in replication were mapped to the
                  entry efficiency of the virus on the basis of
                  spike-pseudotyped virus assays. The defect in entry of Omicron
                  pseudotyped virus to specific cell types effectively
                  correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2, and
                  deletion of TMPRSS2 affected Delta entry to a greater extent
                  than Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific
                  entry pathways3 demonstrated that the Omicron spike
                  inefficiently uses the cellular protease TMPRSS2, which
                  promotes cell entry through plasma membrane fusion, with
                  greater dependency on cell entry through the endocytic
                  pathway. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and
                  inability to use TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron
                  spike was substantially impaired compared with the Delta
                  spike. The less efficient spike cleavage of Omicron at S1/S2
                  is associated with a shift in cellular tropism away from
                  TMPRSS2-expressing cells, with implications for altered
                  pathogenesis.}

                  across variants of concern (VOCs). Here, we examine the
                  contribution of the NTD to infection and cell-cell fusion by
                  constructing chimeric spikes bearing B.1.617 lineage (Delta
                  and Kappa variants) NTDs and generating spike pseudotyped
                  lentivirus. We find that the Delta NTD on a Kappa or wild-type
                  (WT) background increases S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and virus
                  entry, specifically in lung cells and airway organoids,
                  through use of TMPRSS2. Delta exhibits increased cell-cell
                  fusogenicity that could be conferred to WT and Kappa spikes by
                  Delta NTD transfer. However, chimeras of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2
                  spikes with a Delta NTD do not show more efficient TMPRSS2 use
                  or fusogenicity. We conclude that the NTD allosterically
                  modulates S1/S2 cleavage and spike-mediated functions in a
                  spike context-dependent manner, and allosteric interactions
                  may be lost when combining regions from more distantly related

                  in the Spike protein. Del 69-70 causes failure to detect the S

                  SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher). The S gene target failure
                  (SGTF) signature has been used to preliminarily infer the
                  presence of Alpha and Omicron VOC. We evaluated the accuracy
                  of the SGTF signature in identifying these two variants
                  through analysis of all positive SARS-CoV-2 samples tested on

                  value of the SGTF was 98\% for Alpha and 100\% for Omicron.
                  The accuracy of the SGTF signature was high, making this
                  genomic signature a rapid and accurate proxy for

                  of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in daunting numbers of genomic
                  sequences. We witnessed evolutionary events that could mostly
                  be inferred indirectly before, such as the emergence of
                  variants with distinct phenotypes, for example
                  transmissibility, severity and immune evasion. This Review
                  explores the mechanisms that generate genetic variation in
                  SARS-CoV-2, underlying the within-host and population-level
                  processes that underpin these events. We examine the selective

                  transmissibility and, in some cases, higher severity during
                  the first year of the pandemic and the role of antigenic

                  recombination. In order to understand how major lineages, such

                  evidence for the chronic infection model underlying the
                  emergence of VOCs with the possibility of an animal reservoir
                  playing a role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and conclude that the
                  former is more likely. We evaluate uncertainties and outline

                  protein E, forms a homopentameric cation channel that is
                  important for virus pathogenicity. Here we report a 2.1-Ã
                  structure and the drug-binding site of E's transmembrane
                  domain (ETM), determined using solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
                  In lipid bilayers that mimic the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi
                  intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membrane, ETM forms a
                  five-helix bundle surrounding a narrow pore. The protein
                  deviates from the ideal Î±-helical geometry due to three
                  phenylalanine residues, which stack within each helix and
                  between helices. Together with valine and leucine
                  interdigitation, these cause a dehydrated pore compared with
                  the viroporins of influenza viruses and HIV. Hexamethylene
                  amiloride binds the polar amino-terminal lumen, whereas acidic
                  pH affects the carboxy-terminal conformation. Thus, the N- and
                  C-terminal halves of this bipartite channel may interact with
                  other viral and host proteins semi-independently. The
                  structure sets the stage for designing E inhibitors as
                  antiviral drugs.}

                  with an unusually large genome of 30 kb. They express an
                  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a cohort of other replication
                  enzymes and supporting factors to transcribe and replicate
                  their genomes. The proteins performing these essential
                  processes are prime antiviral drug targets, but drug discovery
                  is hindered by our incomplete understanding of coronavirus RNA
                  synthesis and processing. In infected cells, the RNA-dependent
                  RNA polymerase must coordinate with other viral and host

                  disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently
                  outcompetes the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells
                  and primary human airway tissues. The Delta spike mutation
                  P681R is located at a furin cleavage site that separates the
                  spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to
                  wild-type P681 significantly reduces the replication of the
                  Delta variant to a level lower than the Alpha variant.
                  Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhances the

                  rapidly owing to an increase in infection and/or transmission
                  efficiency1. The Alpha variant contains 19 nonsynonymous
                  mutations across its viral genome, including 8 substitutions
                  or deletions in the spike protein that interacts with cellular
                  receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here, using a

                  over to other countries around the world1-3. To better
                  understand the initial step of infection at an atomic level,
                  we determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
                  receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound to the cell receptor ACE2
                  at 2.45 Ã resolution. The overall ACE2-binding mode of the
                  SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV
                  RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor4.
                  Structural analysis identified residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
                  that are critical for ACE2 binding, the majority of which
                  either are highly conserved or share similar side chain
                  properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in
                  structure and sequence strongly argue for convergent evolution
                  between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs for improved binding
                  to ACE2, although SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS and
                  SARS-related coronaviruses1-3,5. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV
                  antibodies targeting the RBD are also analysed with the
                  SARS-CoV-2 RBD, providing insights into the future

  abstract     = {UNLABELLED: The coronavirus membrane (M) protein is the
                  central actor in virion morphogenesis. M organizes the
                  components of the viral membrane, and interactions of M with
                  itself and with the nucleocapsid (N) protein drive virus
                  assembly and budding. In order to further define M-M and M-N
                  interactions, we constructed mutants of the model coronavirus
                  mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in which all or part of the M
                  protein was replaced by its phylogenetically divergent
                  counterpart from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
                  (SARS-CoV). We were able to obtain viable chimeras containing
                  the entire SARS-CoV M protein as well as mutants with
                  intramolecular substitutions that partitioned M protein at the
                  boundaries between the ectodomain, transmembrane domains, or
                  endodomain. Our results show that the carboxy-terminal domain
                  of N protein, N3, is necessary and sufficient for interaction
                  with M protein. However, despite some previous genetic and
                  biochemical evidence that mapped interactions with N to the
                  carboxy terminus of M, it was not possible to define a short
                  linear region of M protein sufficient for assembly with N.
                  Thus, interactions with N protein likely involve multiple
                  linearly discontiguous regions of the M endodomain. The
                  SARS-CoV M chimera exhibited a conditional growth defect that
                  was partially suppressed by mutations in the envelope (E)
                  protein. Moreover, virions of the M chimera were markedly
                  deficient in spike (S) protein incorporation. These findings
                  suggest that the interactions of M protein with both E and S
                  protein are more complex than previously thought. IMPORTANCE:
                  The assembly of coronavirus virions entails concerted
                  interactions among the viral structural proteins and the RNA
                  genome. One strategy to study this process is through
                  construction of interspecies chimeras that preserve or disrupt
                  particular inter- or intramolecular associations. In this
                  work, we replaced the membrane (M) protein of the model
                  coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus with its counterpart from a
                  heterologous coronavirus. The results clarify our
                  understanding of the interaction between the coronavirus M
                  protein and the nucleocapsid protein. At the same time, they
                  reveal unanticipated complexities in the interactions of M
                  with the viral spike and envelope proteins.}

                  graphical viewer for genomic data now in its 13th year. Since
                  the early days of the Human Genome Project, it has presented
                  an integrated view of genomic data of many kinds. Now home to
                  assemblies for 58 organisms, the Browser presents
                  visualization of annotations mapped to genomic coordinates.
                  The ability to juxtapose annotations of many types facilitates
                  inquiry-driven data mining. Gene predictions, mRNA alignments,
                  epigenomic data from the ENCODE project, conservation scores
                  from vertebrate whole-genome alignments and variation data may
                  be viewed at any scale from a single base to an entire
                  chromosome. The Browser also includes many other widely used
                  tools, including BLAT, which is useful for alignments from
                  high-throughput sequencing experiments. Private data uploaded
                  as Custom Tracks and Data Hubs in many formats may be
                  displayed alongside the rich compendium of precomputed data in
                  the UCSC database. The Table Browser is a full-featured
                  graphical interface, which allows querying, filtering and
                  intersection of data tables. The Saved Session feature allows
                  users to store and share customized views, enhancing the
                  utility of the system for organizing multiple trains of
                  thought. Binary Alignment/Map (BAM), Variant Call Format and
                  the Personal Genome Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
                  data formats are useful for visualizing a large sequencing
                  experiment (whole-genome or whole-exome), where the
                  differences between the data set and the reference assembly
                  may be displayed graphically. Support for high-throughput
                  sequencing extends to compact, indexed data formats, such as
                  BAM, bigBed and bigWig, allowing rapid visualization of large

                  advantages and limitations of different protocols is key when
                  conducting population-level WGS. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples
                  with Ct values of 14-30 were run using three different
                  protocols: the Twist Bioscience SARSâCoVâ2 protocol with bait
                  hybridization enrichment sequenced with Illumina, and two

                  human contamination, laborious workflow, high cost, and
                  variation between batches. The ARTIC and Midnight protocol
                  produced an even coverage across samples, and almost all reads

                  designations were uniform across methods, representing the
                  dominant lineages in Sweden during the period of collection.
                  This study provides insights into methodological differences
                  in SARSâCoVâ2 sequencing and guidance in selecting suitable

                  with individuals presenting from December 28, 2020 to May 6,
                  2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) the predominant variant). We assessed
                  illness (symptoms, duration, presentation to hospital) during
                  Alpha- and Delta-predominant timeframes; and transmission,
                  reinfection, and vaccine effectiveness during the
                  Delta-predominant period. 3581 individuals (aged 18 to 100
                  years) from each timeframe were assessed. The seven most
                  frequent symptoms were common to both variants. Within the
                  first 28 days of illness, some symptoms were more common with
                  Delta versus Alpha infection (including fever, sore throat,
                  and headache) and some vice versa (dyspnoea). Symptom burden
                  in the first week was higher with Delta versus Alpha
                  infection; however, the odds of any given symptom lasting â¥ 7
                  days was either lower or unchanged. Illness duration â¥ 28 days
                  was lower with Delta versus Alpha infection, though unchanged
                  in unvaccinated individuals. Hospitalisation for COVID-19 was
                  unchanged. The Delta variant appeared more (1.49)
                  transmissible than Alpha. Re-infections were low in all UK
                  regions. Vaccination markedly reduced the risk of Delta
                  infection (by 69-84\%). We conclude that COVID-19 from Delta
                  or Alpha infections is similar. The Delta variant is more
                  transmissible than Alpha; however, current vaccines showed
                  good efficacy against disease. This research framework can be
                  useful for future comparisons with new emerging variants.}

                  (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
                  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a Public Health Emergency
                  of International Concern, which was officially declared by the
                  World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the
                  family Coronaviridae that consists of a group of enveloped
                  viruses with single-stranded RNA genome, which cause diseases
                  ranging from common colds to acute respiratory distress
                  syndrome. Although the major transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2
                  are inhalation of aerosol/droplet and person-to-person
                  contact, currently available evidence indicates that the viral
                  RNA is present in wastewater, suggesting the need to better
                  understand wastewater as potential sources of epidemiological
                  data and human health risks. Here, we review the current
                  knowledge related to the potential of wastewater surveillance
                  to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19, methodologies for
                  the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater,
                  and information relevant for human health risk assessment of
                  SARS-CoV-2. There has been growing evidence of
                  gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections and
                  the presence of viral RNA not only in feces of infected
                  individuals but also in wastewater. One of the major
                  challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection/quantification in
                  wastewater samples is the lack of an optimized and
                  standardized protocol. Currently available data are also
                  limited for conducting a quantitative microbial risk
                  assessment (QMRA) for SARS-CoV-2 exposure pathways. However,
                  modeling-based approaches have a potential role to play in
                  reducing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
                  Furthermore, QMRA parameters obtained from previous studies on
                  relevant respiratory viruses help to inform risk assessments
                  of SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding on the potential role of
                  wastewater in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is largely limited by
                  knowledge gaps in its occurrence, persistence, and removal in
                  wastewater. There is an urgent need for further research to
                  establish methodologies for wastewater surveillance and
                  understand the implications of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in

                  adaptive evolution is driving the accumulation of mutations

                  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed a grave threat
                  to public health. Virus-specific countermeasures, such as
                  vaccines and therapeutics, have been developed and have
                  contributed to the control of the viral pandemic, which has
                  become endemic. Nonetheless, new variants continue to emerge
                  and could cause a new pandemic. Consequently, it is important
                  to comprehensively understand viral evolution and the roles of
                  mutations in viral infectivity and transmission. SARS-CoV-2
                  beta variant encode mutations (D614G, N501Y, E484K, and K417N)
                  in the spike which are frequently found in other variants as
                  well. While their individual role in viral infectivity has
                  been elucidated against various therapeutic antibodies, it
                  still remains unclear whether those mutations may act
                  additively or synergistically when combined. Here, we report
                  that N501Y mutation shows differential effect on two
                  therapeutic antibodies tested. Interestingly, the relative
                  importance of E484K and K417N mutations in antibody evasion
                  varies depending on the antibody type. Collectively, these
                  findings suggest that continuous efforts to develop effective
                  antibody therapeutics and combinatorial treatment with

                  We found that BA.2.86 does not have significantly more escape
                  relative to Omicron XBB.1.5 from neutralizing immunity
                  elicited by either Omicron XBB-family subvariant infection or
                  from residual neutralizing immunity of recently collected sera
                  from the South African population. BA.2.86 does have extensive

                  (B.1 lineage) when neutralized by sera from pre-Omicron

                  BA.2.86 and XBB.1.5 show similar viral infection dynamics in
                  the VeroE6-TMPRSS2 and H1299-ACE2 cell lines. We also
                  investigate the relationship of BA.2.86 to BA.2 sequences. The
                  closest BA.2 sequences are BA.2 samples from Southern Africa
                  circulating in early 2022. Similarly, many basal BA.2.86
                  sequences were sampled in Southern Africa. This suggests that
                  BA.2.86 potentially evolved in this region, and that
                  unobserved evolution led to escape from neutralizing

                  has been rapidly evolving in the form of new variants. At
                  least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective
                  of this study was to delineate the differences in the
                  mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants.
                  High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and
                  Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to
                  determine the prevalence of mutations (â¥20 \%) in the entire
                  SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in
                  prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was
                  conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on
                  antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using
                  phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates
                  to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its
                  presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a
                  significant number of high-prevalence mutations (â¥20 \%) than
                  in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D,
                  A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in
                  the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations
                  in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in
                  the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a
                  (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant
                  with 58 \% prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I,
                  A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more
                  prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant.
                  Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the
                  sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with
                  antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached
                  the United States through England and Japan, followed by its
                  spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results
                  presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus
                  variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus
                  variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta
                  variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep
                  the structural integrity of the virus.},

                  samples from 32 patients having acute disease and 30 patients

                  epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein, located at the very N-
                  and C-termini, showing almost similar levels of reactivity as
                  immunodominant linear epitopes derived from the spike and
                  nucleocapsid protein. Anti-M is also present in the
                  convalescent phase of COVID-19 patients, however at lower

                  no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this
                  disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited.
                  Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to
                  rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining
                  structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and
                  high-throughput screening. This programme focused on
                  identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of
                  SARS-CoV-2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a
                  pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription,
                  making it an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-25,6. We
                  identified a mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) by computer-aided
                  drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro
                  of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with this compound. Through a
                  combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput
                  screening, we assayed more than 10,000 compounds-including
                  approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other
                  pharmacologically active compounds-as inhibitors of Mpro. Six
                  of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing half-maximal
                  inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4
                  Î¼M. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising
                  antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results
                  demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can
                  lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical
                  potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no

                  F456L evade RBD-targeting Class 1 public NAbs, reducing the
                  neutralization efficacy of XBB breakthrough infection (BTI)
                  and reinfection convalescent plasma. Importantly, L455F single
                  substitution significantly dampens receptor binding; however,
                  the combination of L455F and F456L forms an adjacent residue
                  flipping, which leads to enhanced NAbs resistance and ACE2
                  binding affinity. The perturbed receptor-binding mode leads to
                  the exceptional ACE2 binding and NAb evasion, as revealed by
                  structural analyses. Our results indicate the evolution
                  flexibility contributed by epistasis cannot be underestimated,
                  and the evolution potential of SARS-CoV-2 RBD remains high.}

                  with an equally unprecedented scientific response. Much of

                  SARS-CoV-2, became a source of intense interest for non-expert
                  audiences. The viral spike protein gained particular public
                  interest as the main target for protective immune responses,
                  including those elicited by vaccines. The rapid evolution of
                  SARS-CoV-2 resulted in variations in the spike that enhanced
                  transmissibility or weakened vaccine protection. This created
                  new variants of concern (VOCs). The emergence of VOCs was
                  studied using viral sequence data which was shared through
                  portals such as the online Mutation Explorer of the COVID-19
                  Genomics UK consortium (COG-UK/ME). This was designed for an
                  expert audience, but the information it contained could be of
                  general interest if suitably communicated. Visualisations,
                  interactivity and animation can improve engagement and
                  understanding of molecular biology topics, and so we developed
                  a graphical educational resource, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein
                  Mutation Explorer (SSPME), which used interactive 3D molecular
                  models and animations to explain the molecular biology
                  underpinning VOCs. User testing showed that the SSPME had
                  better usability and improved participant knowledge confidence
                  and knowledge acquisition compared to COG-UK/ME. This
                  demonstrates how interactive visualisations can be used for
                  effective molecular biology communication, as well as

                  disease severity in adults hospitalised with Delta and Omicron
                  SARS-CoV-2 variant infections. However, limited data exist
                  assessing severity of disease in adults hospitalised with
                  Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infections, and to what extent
                  patient-factors, including vaccination, age, frailty and
                  pre-existing disease, affect variant-dependent disease
                  severity. Methods: A prospective cohort study of adults (â¥18
                  years of age) hospitalised with acute lower respiratory tract
                  disease at acute care hospitals in Bristol, UK conducted over
                  10-months. Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined
                  by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and variant identification or
                  inferred by dominant circulating variant. We constructed
                  adjusted regression analyses to assess disease severity using
                  three different measures: FiO2 Â¿28\% (fraction inspired
                  oxygen), World Health Organization (WHO) outcome score Â¿5
                  (assessing need for ventilatory support), and hospital length
                  of stay (LOS) Â¿3 days following admission for Omicron or Delta
                  infection. Findings: Independent of other variables, including
                  vaccination, Omicron variant infection in hospitalised adults
                  was associated with lower severity than Delta. Risk reductions
                  were 58\%, 67\%, and 16\% for supplementary oxygen with Â¿28\%
                  FiO2 [Relative Risk (RR) = 0.42 (95\%CI: 0.34-0.52), P 5 [RR =
                  0.33 (95\%CI: 0.21-0.50), P 3 days [RR = 0.84 (95\%CI:
                  0.76-0.92), P Â¡ 0.001]. Younger age and vaccination with two
                  or three doses were also independently associated with lower
                  COVID-19 severity. Interpretation: We provide reassuring
                  evidence that Omicron infection results in less serious
                  adverse outcomes than Delta in hospitalised patients. Despite
                  lower severity relative to Delta, Omicron infection still
                  resulted in substantial patient and public health burden and
                  an increased admission rate of older patients with Omicron
                  which counteracts some of the benefit arising from less severe
                  disease. Funding: AvonCAP is an investigator-led project

                  evasion and is spreading rapidly worldwide. Understanding the
                  structural basis of the high transmissibility and enhanced
                  immune evasion of Omicron is of high importance. Here, using
                  cryo-electron microscopy, we present both the closed and the
                  open states of the Omicron spike (S) protein, which appear
                  more compact than the counterparts of the G614 strain1,
                  potentially related to enhanced inter-protomer and S1-S2
                  interactions induced by Omicron residue substitution. The
                  closed state showing dominant population may indicate a
                  conformational masking mechanism for the immune evasion of
                  Omicron. Moreover, we captured three states for the Omicron
                  S-ACE2 complex, revealing that the substitutions on the
                  Omicron RBM result in new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds,
                  more favourable electrostatic surface properties, and an
                  overall strengthened S-ACE2 interaction, in line with the
                  observed higher ACE2 affinity of Omicron S than of G614.
                  Furthermore, we determined the structures of Omicron S in
                  complex with the Fab of S3H3, an antibody that is able to
                  cross-neutralize major variants of concern including Omicron,
                  elucidating the structural basis for S3H3-mediated
                  broad-spectrum neutralization. Our findings shed light on the
                  receptor engagement and antibody neutralization or evasion of
                  Omicron and may also inform the design of broadly effective
                  vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.}

                  coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses an RNA-dependent RNA
                  polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the
                  transcription of its genes1-3. Here we present a cryo-electron
                  microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in an active form
                  that mimics the replicating enzyme. The structure comprises
                  the viral proteins non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), nsp8 and
                  nsp7, and more than two turns of RNA template-product duplex.
                  The active-site cleft of nsp12 binds to the first turn of RNA
                  and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues. Two copies
                  of nsp8 bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the
                  second turn of RNA. Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude
                  along exiting RNA, forming positively charged 'sliding poles'.
                  These sliding poles can account for the known processivity of
                  RdRp that is required for replicating the long genome of
                  coronaviruses3. Our results enable a detailed analysis of the
                  inhibitory mechanisms that underlie the antiviral activity of
                  substances such as remdesivir, a drug for the treatment of
                  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)4.}

  abstract     = {The first SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) to be designated
                  was lineage B.1.1.7, later labelled by the World Health
                  Organization as Alpha. Originating in early autumn but
                  discovered in December 2020, it spread rapidly and caused
                  large waves of infections worldwide. The Alpha variant is
                  notable for being defined by a long ancestral phylogenetic
                  branch with an increased evolutionary rate, along which only
                  two sequences have been sampled. Alpha genomes comprise a
                  well-supported monophyletic clade within which the
                  evolutionary rate is typical of SARS-CoV-2. The Alpha epidemic
                  continued to grow despite the continued restrictions on social
                  mixing across the UK and the imposition of new restrictions,
                  in particular, the English national lockdown in November 2020.
                  While these interventions succeeded in reducing the absolute
                  number of cases, the impact of these non-pharmaceutical
                  interventions was predominantly to drive the decline of the
                  SARS-CoV-2 lineages that preceded Alpha. We investigate the
                  only two sampled sequences that fall on the branch ancestral
                  to Alpha. We find that one is likely to be a true intermediate
                  sequence, providing information about the order of mutational
                  events that led to Alpha. We explore alternate hypotheses that
                  can explain how Alpha acquired a large number of mutations yet
                  remained largely unobserved in a region of high genomic
                  surveillance: an under-sampled geographical location, a
                  non-human animal population, or a chronically infected
                  individual. We conclude that the latter provides the best
                  explanation of the observed behaviour and dynamics of the
                  variant, although the individual need not be
                  immunocompromised, as persistently infected immunocompetent
                  hosts also display a higher within-host rate of evolution.
                  Finally, we compare the ancestral branches and mutation
                  profiles of other VOCs and find that Delta appears to be an
                  outlier both in terms of the genomic locations of its defining
                  mutations and a lack of the rapid evolutionary rate on its
                  ancestral branch. As new variants, such as Omicron, continue
                  to evolve (potentially through similar mechanisms), it remains
                  important to investigate the origins of other variants to
                  identify ways to potentially disrupt their evolution and
                  emergence.},

                  sequences spawned the development of powerful protein language
                  models (pLMs). Concurrently, AlphaFold2 broke through in
                  protein structure prediction. Now we can systematically and
                  comprehensively explore the dual nature of proteins that act
                  and exist as three-dimensional (3D) machines and evolve as
                  linear strings of one-dimensional (1D) sequences. Here, we
                  leverage pLMs to simultaneously model both modalities by
                  combining 1D sequences with 3D structure in a single model. We
                  encode protein structures as token sequences using the
                  3Di-alphabet introduced by the 3D-alignment methodFoldseek.
                  This new foundation pLM extracts the features and patterns of
                  the resulting âstructure-sequenceâ representation. Toward this
                  end, we built a non-redundant dataset from AlphaFoldDB and
                  fine-tuned an existing pLM (ProtT5) to translate between 3Di
                  and amino acid sequences. As a proof-of-concept for our novel
                  approach, dubbed Protein structure-sequence T5 (ProstT5), we
                  showed improved performance for subsequent prediction tasks,
                  and for âinverse foldingâ, namely the generation of novel
                  protein sequences adopting a given structural scaffold
                  (âfoldâ). Our work showcased the potential of pLMs to tap into
                  the information-rich protein structure revolution fueled by
                  AlphaFold2.ProstT5paves the way to develop new tools

                  either deleterious and swiftly purged or relatively neutral, a
                  small proportion will affect functional properties and may
                  alter infectivity, disease severity or interactions with host
                  immunity. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 was
                  followed by a period of relative evolutionary stasis lasting
                  about 11 months. Since late 2020, however, SARS-CoV-2
                  evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of
                  mutations, in the context of 'variants of concern', that
                  impact virus characteristics, including transmissibility and
                  antigenicity, probably in response to the changing immune
                  profile of the human population. There is emerging evidence of
                  reduced neutralization of some SARS-CoV-2 variants by
                  postvaccination serum; however, a greater understanding of
                  correlates of protection is required to evaluate how this may

                  preparing platforms for a possible update of vaccine
                  sequences, and it is crucial that surveillance of genetic and
                  antigenic changes in the global virus population is done
                  alongside experiments to elucidate the phenotypic impacts of
                  mutations. In this Review, we summarize the literature on
                  mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the primary
                  antigen, focusing on their impacts on antigenicity and
                  contextualizing them in the protein structure, and discuss
                  them in the context of observed mutation frequencies in global

                  (SARS-CoV-2) surveillance is to rapidly identify viral
                  variants with mutations that reduce neutralization by
                  polyclonal antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection.
                  Unfortunately, direct experimental characterization of new
                  viral variants lags their sequence-based identification. Here
                  we help address this challenge by aggregating deep mutational
                  scanning data into an 'escape estimator' that estimates the
                  antigenic effects of arbitrary combinations of mutations to
                  the virus's spike receptor-binding domain. The estimator can
                  be used to intuitively visualize how mutations impact
                  polyclonal antibody recognition and score the expected
                  antigenic effect of combinations of mutations. These scores
                  correlate with neutralization assays performed on SARS-CoV-2
                  variants and emphasize the ominous antigenic properties of the
                  recently described Omicron variant. An interactive version of
                  the estimator is at

                  for batch processing. Currently the calculator uses primarily
                  data for antibodies elicited by Wuhan-Hu-1-like vaccination or
                  infection and so is expected to work best for calculating
                  escape from such immunity for mutations relative to early

                  to the spike's receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target

                  antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in
                  the RBD, but longitudinal samples reveal that the impact of
                  these mutations on antibody binding varies substantially both
                  among individuals and within the same individual over time.
                  Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the
                  mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at

                  antibody classes to the polyclonal response remains unclear.
                  Here we use a yeast-display system to map all mutations to the
                  viral spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that escape binding
                  by representatives of three potently neutralizing classes of

                  While the binding of polyclonal plasma antibodies are affected

                  concern, the global scientific community, through

                  genomes through GISAID, as of May 2022. This extraordinarily
                  high sampling rate provides a unique opportunity to track the

                  outbreak.info , a platform that currently tracks over 40
                  million combinations of Pango lineages and individual
                  mutations, across over 7,000 locations, to provide insights
                  for researchers, public health officials and the general
                  public. We describe the interpretable visualizations available
                  in our web application, the pipelines that enable the scalable
                  ingestion of heterogeneous sources of SARS-CoV-2 variant data
                  and the server infrastructure that enables widespread data
                  dissemination via a high-performance API that can be accessed
                  using an R package. We show how outbreak.info can be used for

                  assembly of virus-like particles in cells. As a step toward
                  understanding the function of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)
                  E protein, we carried out clustered charged-to-alanine
                  mutagenesis on the E gene and incorporated the resulting
                  mutations into the MHV genome by targeted recombination. Of
                  the four possible clustered charged-to-alanine E gene mutants,
                  one was apparently lethal and one had a wild-type phenotype.
                  The two other mutants were partially temperature sensitive,
                  forming small plaques at the nonpermissive temperature.
                  Revertant analyses of these two mutants demonstrated that the
                  created mutations were responsible for the
                  temperature-sensitive phenotype of each and provided support
                  for possible interactions among E protein monomers. Both
                  temperature-sensitive mutants were also found to be markedly
                  thermolabile when grown at the permissive temperature,
                  suggesting that there was a flaw in their assembly. Most
                  significantly, when virions of one of the mutants were
                  examined by electron microscopy, they were found to have
                  strikingly aberrant morphology in comparison to the wild type:
                  most mutant virions had pinched and elongated shapes that were
                  rarely seen among wild-type virions. These results demonstrate
                  an important, probably essential, role for the E protein in
                  coronavirus morphogenesis.}

                  is the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529). The Omicron variant is the
                  most mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant, and its high transmissibility
                  and immune evasion ability have raised global concerns. Owing
                  to its enhanced transmissibility, Omicron has rapidly replaced
                  Delta as the dominant variant in several regions. However,
                  recent studies have shown that the Omicron variant exhibits
                  reduced pathogenicity due to altered cell tropism. In

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: In a previous paper, we introduced MUSCLE, a new
                  program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences,
                  giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to
                  achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment
                  accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete
                  discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously
                  unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and /
                  or computational complexity. We introduce a new option,
                  MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We
                  also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective
                  functions that align two profiles. RESULTS: We compare the
                  speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA
                  and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published
                  program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four
                  benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three
                  variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default
                  settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen
                  compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast
                  to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving
                  average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that
                  are typically two to three orders of magnitude less.
                  MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length
                  282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer. CONCLUSIONS:
                  MUSCLE offers a range of options that provide improved speed
                  and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available
                  programs. MUSCLE is freely available at

                  inference methods have made important contributions to the
                  theory of sequence database homology search. However,
                  practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the
                  computational expense of existing software implementations.
                  Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs,
                  the âmultiple segment Viterbiâ (MSV) algorithm. The MSV
                  algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local
                  alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach
                  previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV
                  scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped
                  optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of
                  significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as
                  a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of
                  the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a
                  method I call âsparse rescalingâ. These methods are assembled
                  in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for
                  reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This
                  accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available
                  HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the
                  use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible
                  sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches.
                  HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold
                  faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for
                  protein searches.}

                  estimate that Delta infections generate on average 6.2 (95\%
                  CI 3.1-10.9) times more viral RNA copies per milliliter than
                  Alpha infections during their respective emergence. Overall,
                  our evidence suggests that Delta's enhanced transmissibility
                  can be attributed to its innate ability to increase
                  infectiousness, but its epidemiological dynamics may vary
                  depending on underlying population attributes and sequencing
                  data availability.},

                  recently been identified as a new clinical entity. SARS is
                  thought to be caused by an unknown infectious agent. METHODS:
                  Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were searched for
                  unknown viruses with the use of cell cultures and molecular
                  techniques. RESULTS: A novel coronavirus was identified in
                  patients with SARS. The virus was isolated in cell culture,
                  and a sequence 300 nucleotides in length was obtained by a
                  polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-based random-amplification
                  procedure. Genetic characterization indicated that the virus
                  is only distantly related to known coronaviruses (identical in
                  50 to 60 percent of the nucleotide sequence). On the basis of
                  the obtained sequence, conventional and real-time PCR assays
                  for specific and sensitive detection of the novel virus were
                  established. Virus was detected in a variety of clinical
                  specimens from patients with SARS but not in controls. High
                  concentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per
                  milliliter were found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected
                  at extremely low concentrations in plasma during the acute
                  phase and in feces during the late convalescent phase.
                  Infected patients showed seroconversion on the Vero cells in
                  which the virus was isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The novel
                  coronavirus might have a role in causing SARS.}

  abstract     = {The spike protein determines the host-range specificity of
                  coronaviruses. In particular, the Receptor-Binding Motif in
                  the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 contains the amino acids
                  involved in molecular recognition of the host Angiotensin
                  Converting Enzyme 2. Therefore, to understand how SARS-CoV-2
                  acquired its capacity to infect humans it is necessary to
                  reconstruct the evolution of this important motif. Early
                  during the pandemic, it was proposed that the SARS-CoV-2
                  Receptor-Binding Domain was acquired via recombination with a
                  pangolin infecting coronavirus. This proposal was challenged
                  by an alternative explanation that suggested that the
                  Receptor-Binding Domain from SARS-CoV-2 did not originated via
                  recombination with a coronavirus from a pangolin. Instead,
                  this alternative hypothesis proposed that the Receptor-Binding
                  Motif from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, was acquired via
                  recombination with an unidentified coronavirus. And as a
                  consequence of this event, the Receptor-Binding Domain from
                  the pangolin coronavirus appeared as phylogenetically closer
                  to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, the genomes from coronaviruses from
                  Cambodia (bat\_RShST182/200) and Laos (BANAL-20-52/103/247)
                  which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 were reported.
                  However, no detailed analysis of the evolution of the
                  Receptor-Binding Motif from these coronaviruses was reported.
                  Here we revisit the evolution of the Receptor-Binding Domain
                  and Motif in the light of the novel coronavirus genome
                  sequences. Specifically, we wanted to test whether the above
                  coronaviruses from Cambodia and Laos were the source of the
                  Receptor-Binding Domain from RaTG13. We found that the
                  Receptor-Binding Motif from these coronaviruses is
                  phylogenetically closer to SARS-CoV-2 than to RaTG13.
                  Therefore, the source of the Receptor-Binding Domain from
                  RaTG13 is still unidentified. In accordance with previous
                  studies, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that
                  the Receptor-Binding Motif from SARS-CoV-2 evolved by vertical
                  inheritance from a bat-infecting population of coronaviruses.},

                  developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been
                  adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI

  abstract     = {Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is uncontrolled in many parts of
                  the world; control is compounded in some areas by the higher
                  transmission potential of the B.1.1.7 variant1, which has now
                  been reported in 94 countries. It is unclear whether the
                  response of the virus to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 on the
                  basis of the prototypic strain will be affected by the
                  mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assess the immune
                  responses of individuals after vaccination with the mRNA-based
                  vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralizing antibody responses
                  after the first and second immunizations using pseudoviruses
                  that expressed the wild-type spike protein or a mutated spike
                  protein that contained the eight amino acid changes found in
                  the B.1.1.7 variant. The sera from individuals who received
                  the vaccine exhibited a broad range of neutralizing titres
                  against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced
                  against the B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident
                  in sera from some patients who had recovered from COVID-19.
                  Decreased neutralization of the B.1.1.7 variant was also
                  observed for monoclonal antibodies that target the N-terminal
                  domain (9 out of 10) and the receptor-binding motif (5 out of
                  31), but not for monoclonal antibodies that recognize the
                  receptor-binding domain that bind outside the receptor-binding
                  motif. Introduction of the mutation that encodes the E484K
                  substitution in the B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly
                  emerged variant of concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a
                  more-substantial loss of neutralizing activity by
                  vaccine-elicited antibodies and monoclonal antibodies (19 out
                  of 31) compared with the loss of neutralizing activity
                  conferred by the mutations in B.1.1.7 alone. The emergence of
                  the E484K substitution in a B.1.1.7 background represents a
                  threat to the efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine.}

                  hamster model to compare a clinical strain of Alpha variant
                  with an ancestral G614 strain. The Alpha variant succeed to
                  infect animals and to induce a pathology that mimics COVID-19.
                  However, both strains replicate to almost the same level and
                  induced a comparable disease and immune response. A slight
                  fitness advantage is noted for the G614 strain during

                  differential DNA sequence variants between two or more
                  experimental genomes after genotoxic chemical exposure. Here,
                  we illustrate how SnpSift can be used to identify candidate
                  phenotype-relevant variants including single nucleotide
                  polymorphisms, multiple nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions,
                  and deletions (InDels) in mutant strains isolated from
                  genome-wide chemical mutagenesis of Drosophila melanogaster.
                  First, the genomes of two independently isolated mutant fly
                  strains that are allelic for a novel recessive male-sterile
                  locus generated by genotoxic chemical exposure were sequenced
                  using the Illumina next-generation DNA sequencer to obtain 20-
                  to 29-fold coverage of the euchromatic sequences. The
                  sequencing reads were processed and variants were called using
                  standard bioinformatic tools. Next, SnpEff was used to
                  annotate all sequence variants and their potential mutational
                  effects on associated genes. Then, SnpSift was used to filter
                  and select differential variants that potentially disrupt a
                  common gene in the two allelic mutant strains. The potential
                  causative DNA lesions were partially validated by capillary
                  sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA in the
                  genetic interval as defined by meiotic mapping and deletions
                  that remove defined regions of the chromosome. Of the five
                  candidate genes located in the genetic interval, the Pka-like
                  gene CG12069 was found to carry a separate pre-mature stop
                  codon mutation in each of the two allelic mutants whereas the
                  other four candidate genes within the interval have wild-type
                  sequences. The Pka-like gene is therefore a strong candidate
                  gene for the male-sterile locus. These results demonstrate
                  that combining SnpEff and SnpSift can expedite the
                  identification of candidate phenotype-causative mutations in
                  chemically mutagenized Drosophila strains. This technique can
                  also be used to characterize the variety of mutations
                  generated by genotoxic chemicals.},

                  categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once
                  a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on
                  their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated
                  genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region,
                  upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions.
                  Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid
                  replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or
                  losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of
                  SnpEff is illustrated by annotating 356,660 candidate SNPs in
                  117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of
                  1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster
                  w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1)
                  bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that 15,842 SNPs are synonymous
                  and 4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S 0.28). The remaining
                  SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38
                  SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297
                  SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP
                  frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency
                  (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also
                  found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila
                  melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or
                  C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila
                  species. It appears that the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for
                  genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during
                  evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is
                  becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid
                  analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an

                  The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated and transcribed by the
                  RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme (subunits
                  nsp7/nsp82/nsp12) along with a cast of accessory factors. One
                  of these factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and
                  nsp13 are essential for viral replication and are targets for
                  treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present cryoelectron
                  microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA
                  template product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13
                  helicase. The Nidovirales order-specific N-terminal domains of
                  each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal extension of each copy
                  of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12 thumb. The
                  structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of
                  the helicase directly in front of the replicating-transcribing

                  From continental perspective, Delta VOC predominated in
                  Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania, with
                  proportions of 67.58-98.31\% in July 2021. In South America,
                  proportion of Delta VOC (23.24\%) has been approaching the
                  predominant yet diminishing Gamma VOC (56.86\%). We further
                  analyzed monthly data on new COVID-19 cases, new deaths,
                  vaccination status and variant proportions of 6 countries.
                  Delta VOC predominated in all countries except Brazil (Gamma
                  VOC) in July 2021. In most occasions, rise and predominance of
                  Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Zeta variants were accompanied
                  with surges of new cases, especially after the time point of
                  major lineage interchange. The ascending phases of new cases
                  lasted for 1-5 months with 1.69- to 40.63-fold peak growth,
                  whereas new death tolls varied with regional vaccination
                  status. Our data suggested surges of COVID-19 cases might be
                  predicted from variant surveillance data. Despite vaccine
                  breakthroughs by Delta VOC, death tolls were more stable in
                  countries with better immunization coverage. Another takeaway
                  is the urgent need to improve vaccine efficacy against Delta

  abstract     = {The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant encodes 37
                  amino acid substitutions in the spike protein, 15 of which are
                  in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), thereby raising concerns
                  about the effectiveness of available vaccines and
                  antibody-based therapeutics. Here we show that the Omicron RBD
                  binds to human ACE2 with enhanced affinity, relative to the
                  Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD, and binds to mouse ACE2. Marked reductions in
                  neutralizing activity were observed against Omicron compared
                  to the ancestral pseudovirus in plasma from convalescent
                  individuals and from individuals who had been vaccinated
                  against SARS-CoV-2, but this loss was less pronounced after a
                  third dose of vaccine. Most monoclonal antibodies that are
                  directed against the receptor-binding motif lost in vitro
                  neutralizing activity against Omicron, with only 3 out of 29
                  monoclonal antibodies retaining unaltered potency, including
                  the ACE2-mimicking S2K146 antibody1. Furthermore, a fraction
                  of broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus monoclonal antibodies
                  neutralized Omicron through recognition of antigenic sites
                  outside the receptor-binding motif, including sotrovimab2,
                  S2X2593 and S2H974. The magnitude of Omicron-mediated immune
                  evasion marks a major antigenic shift in SARS-CoV-2. Broadly
                  neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize RBD epitopes
                  that are conserved among SARS-CoV-2 variants and other
                  sarbecoviruses may prove key to controlling the ongoing
                  pandemic and future zoonotic spillovers.}

                  conformations, including a closed state unable to bind the
                  ACE2 receptor, and an open state that does so but displays
                  more exposed antigenic surface. Spikes of variants of concern
                  (VOCs) acquired amino acid changes linked to increased
                  virulence and immune evasion. Here, using HDX-MS, we
                  identified changes in spike dynamics that we associate with
                  the transition from closed to open conformations, to ACE2
                  binding, and to specific mutations in VOCs. We show that the
                  RBD-associated subdomain plays a role in spike opening,
                  whereas the NTD acts as a hotspot of conformational divergence
                  of VOC spikes driving immune evasion. Alpha, beta and delta
                  spikes assume predominantly open conformations and ACE2
                  binding increases the dynamics of their core helices, priming
                  spikes for fusion. Conversely, substitutions in omicron spike
                  lead to predominantly closed conformations, presumably
                  enabling it to escape antibodies. At the same time, its core
                  helices show characteristics of being pre-primed for fusion
                  even in the absence of ACE2. These data inform on SARS-CoV-2

                  September 2020 before becoming the majority strain in the UK
                  and spreading worldwide. The rapid spread of the B.1.1.7
                  variant results from increased transmissibility but the
                  virological characteristics which underpin this advantage over

                  B.1.1.7 and other contemporaneous SARS-CoV-2 strains in
                  primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. However, B.1.1.7
                  replication is disadvantaged in Vero cells potentially due to
                  increased furin-mediated cleavage of its spike protein as a
                  result of a P681H mutation directly adjacent to the S1/S2
                  cleavage site. In addition, we show that B.1.1.7 does not
                  escape neutralisation by convalescent or post-vaccination
                  sera. Thus, increased transmission of B.1.1.7 is not caused by
                  increased replication, as measured on HAE cells, or escape
                  from serological immunity.}

                  serine protease furin, which cleaves a plethora of proteins at
                  polybasic recognition motifs. Mammalian substrates of furin

                  associated with a variety of disorders including cancer.
                  Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of furin is exploited by
                  numerous viral and bacterial pathogens, thereby enhancing
                  their virulence and spread. In this review, we describe the

                  discuss how dysregulation of a simple proteolytic cleavage

                  lineage B.1.617.2, was first detected in India in July 2020
                  and rapidly became dominant worldwide. The ARTIC v3 protocol
                  for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing, which relies on a
                  large number of PCR primers, was among the first available
                  early in the pandemic, but may be prone to coverage dropouts
                  that result in incomplete genome sequences. A new set of
                  primers (v4) was designed to circumvent this issue in June
                  2021. In this study, we investigated whether the sequencing
                  community adopted the new sets of primers, especially in the
                  context of the spread of the Delta lineage, in July 2021.
                  Because information about protocols from individual

                  were present in deposited Delta variant genome sequences (from
                  April to August 2021), to investigate the extent of the
                  coverage dropout among all the currently available Delta
                  sequences in six countries, and to propose simple PCR primer
                  modifications to sequence the missing region, especially for
                  the first circulating Delta variants observed in 2021 in
                  Switzerland. Candidate primers were tested on few clinical
                  samples, highlighting the need to further pursue primer
                  optimization and validation on a larger and diverse set of

                  of reservoir species, the role of recombination and its time
                  of divergence from animal viruses. We find that the
                  sarbecoviruses-the viral subgenus containing SARS-CoV and
                  SARS-CoV-2-undergo frequent recombination and exhibit
                  spatially structured genetic diversity on a regional scale in
                  China. SARS-CoV-2 itself is not a recombinant of any
                  sarbecoviruses detected to date, and its receptor-binding
                  motif, important for specificity to human ACE2 receptors,
                  appears to be an ancestral trait shared with bat viruses and
                  not one acquired recently via recombination. To employ
                  phylogenetic dating methods, recombinant regions of a
                  68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three
                  independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence
                  date estimates were shown to be consistent for these three
                  approaches and for two different prior specifications of
                  evolutionary rates based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV. Divergence
                  dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir
                  were estimated as 1948 (95\% highest posterior density (HPD):
                  1879-1999), 1969 (95\% HPD: 1930-2000) and 1982 (95\% HPD:
                  1948-2009), indicating that the lineage giving rise to

                  mutation rate. Here, we examine whether this mutational
                  process itself has changed during viral evolution. To do this,
                  we quantify the relative rates of different types of
                  single-nucleotide mutations at 4-fold degenerate sites in the
                  viral genome across millions of human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We
                  find clear shifts in the relative rates of several types of
                  mutations during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The most striking trend
                  is a roughly 2-fold decrease in the relative rate of GâT
                  mutations in Omicron versus early clades, as was recently
                  noted by Ruis et al. (2022. Mutational spectra distinguish
                  SARS-CoV-2 replication niches. bioRxiv,
                  doi:10.1101/2022.09.27.509649). There is also a decrease in
                  the relative rate of CâT mutations in Delta, and other subtle
                  changes in the mutation spectrum along the phylogeny. We
                  speculate that these changes in the mutation spectrum could
                  arise from viral mutations that affect genome replication,
                  packaging, and antagonization of host innate-immune factors,
                  although environmental factors could also play a role.
                  Interestingly, the mutation spectrum of Omicron is more
                  similar than that of earlier SARS-CoV-2 clades to the spectrum
                  that shaped the long-term evolution of sarbecoviruses.
                  Overall, our work shows that the mutation process is itself a
                  dynamic variable during SARS-CoV-2 evolution and suggests that
                  human SARS-CoV-2 may be trending toward a mutation spectrum
                  more similar to that of other animal sarbecoviruses.},

                  structures of distinct COVID-19 human neutralizing antibodies5
                  in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural
                  comparisons allowed us to classify the antibodies into
                  categories: (1) neutralizing antibodies encoded by the VH3-53
                  gene segment with short CDRH3 loops that block ACE2 and bind
                  only to 'up' RBDs; (2) ACE2-blocking neutralizing antibodies
                  that bind both up and 'down' RBDs and can contact adjacent
                  RBDs; (3) neutralizing antibodies that bind outside the ACE2
                  site and recognize both up and down RBDs; and (4) previously
                  described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only to
                  up RBDs9. Class 2 contained four neutralizing antibodies with
                  epitopes that bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 antibody that
                  used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between
                  adjacent down RBDs, thereby locking the spike into a closed
                  conformation. Epitope and paratope mapping revealed few
                  interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor
                  contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope
                  contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally
                  occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided
                  insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to escape from
                  antibodies elicited during infection or delivered
                  therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses
                  provide rules for assigning current and future human
                  RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity
                  effects and suggesting combinations for clinical use, and

                  announcement of the change in coronavirus disease 2019 status
                  from epidemic to pandemic disease. The virus that causes this
                  disease is indicated originating from animals traded in a live
                  animal market in Wuhan, China. Severe Acute Respiratory
                  Syndrome Coronavirus 2 can attack lung cells because there are
                  many conserved receptor entries, namely Angiotensin Converting
                  Enzyme-2. The presence of this virus in host cells will
                  initiate various protective responses leading to pneumonia and
                  Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. This review aimed to
                  provide an overview related to this virus and examine the
                  body's responses and possible therapies. METHOD: We searched
                  PubMed databases for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                  Coronavirus-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related
                  coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.
                  Full texts were retrieved, analyzed and developed into an
                  easy-to-understand review. RESULTS: We provide a complete
                  review related to structure, origin, and how the body responds
                  to this virus infection and explain the possibility of an
                  immune system over-reaction or cytokine storm. We also include
                  an explanation of how this virus creates modes of avoidance to
                  evade immune system attacks. We further explain the
                  therapeutic approaches that can be taken in the treatment and
                  prevention of this viral infection. CONCLUSION: In summary,
                  based on the structural and immune-evasion system of

                  coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first
                  century. The constant spillover of coronaviruses from natural

                  nucleotide substitution rates and recombination. At the

                  assembly, through M-M, M-spike (S), and M-nucleocapsid (N)
                  protein interactions. The M carboxy-terminal endodomain
                  contains a conserved domain (CD) following the third
                  transmembrane (TM) domain. The importance of the CD
                  (SWWSFNPETNNL) in mouse hepatitis virus was investigated with
                  a panel of mutant proteins, using genetic analysis and
                  transient-expression assays. A charge reversal for negatively
                  charged E(121) was not tolerated. Lysine (K) and arginine (R)
                  substitutions were replaced in recovered viruses by neutrally
                  charged glutamine (Q) and leucine (L), respectively, after
                  only one passage. E121Q and E121L M proteins were capable of
                  forming virus-like particles (VLPs) when coexpressed with E,
                  whereas E121R and E121K proteins were not. Alanine
                  substitutions for the first four or the last four residues
                  resulted in viruses with significantly crippled phenotypes and
                  proteins that failed to assemble VLPs or to be rescued into
                  the envelope. All recovered viruses with alanine substitutions
                  in place of SWWS residues had second-site, partially
                  compensating, changes in the first TM of M. Alanine
                  substitution for proline had little impact on the virus. N
                  protein coexpression with some M mutants increased VLP
                  production. The results overall suggest that the CD is
                  important for formation of the viral envelope by helping
                  mediate fundamental M-M interactions and that the presence of
                  the N protein may help stabilize M complexes during virus
                  assembly.}

                  increasingly practical way to profile the functional activity
                  of microbial communities in situ. However, MTX remains
                  underutilized due to experimental and computational
                  limitations. The latter are complicated by non-independent
                  changes in both RNA transcript levels and their underlying
                  genomic DNA copies (as microbes simultaneously change their
                  overall abundance in the population and regulate individual
                  transcripts), genetic plasticity (as whole loci are frequently
                  gained and lost in microbial lineages) and measurement
                  compositionality and zero-inflation. Here, we present a
                  systematic evaluation of and recommendations for differential
                  expression (DE) analysis in MTX. RESULTS: We designed and
                  assessed six statistical models for DE discovery in MTX that
                  incorporate different combinations of DNA and RNA
                  normalization and assumptions about the underlying changes of
                  gene copies or species abundance within communities. We
                  evaluated these models on multiple simulated and real
                  multi-omic datasets. Models adjusting transcripts relative to
                  their encoding gene copies as a covariate were significantly
                  more accurate in identifying DE from MTX in both simulated and
                  real datasets. Moreover, we show that when paired DNA
                  measurements (metagenomic data) are not available, models
                  normalizing MTX measurements within-species while also
                  adjusting for total-species RNA balance sensitivity,
                  specificity and interpretability of DE detection, as does
                  filtering likely technical zeros. The efficiency and accuracy
                  of these models pave the way for more effective MTX-based DE
                  discovery in microbial communities. AVAILABILITY AND

                  similar folds and interaction patterns, but whose sequence
                  similarity is below the threshold of easily recognizable
                  sequence homology. The existence of multiple sequence
                  solutions for a given fold has inspired fold prediction
                  methods in which structural information from one protein is
                  used to estimate the energy of another, putatively similar,
                  structure. RESULTS: A set of 68 pairs of proteins with similar
                  folds and sequence identity in the 8-30\% range is identified
                  from the literature. for each pair, the energy of one protein,
                  calculated using knowledge-based statistical potentials, is
                  compared to the estimated energy, calculated with the same
                  potentials but using the structural information (burial status
                  and interaction pattern) of another protein with the same
                  fold. Different energy estimates, corresponding to
                  approximations used in various fold recognition algorithms,
                  are calculated and compared to each other, as well as to the
                  correct energy. It is shown that the local energy terms, based
                  on burial and secondary structure preferences, can be reliably
                  estimated with an accuracy close to 70\%. At the same time,
                  the two-body nonlocal energy loses over 60\% of its value due
                  to the repacking of the structure. Further approximations,
                  such as the 'frozen approximation', can bring it to an
                  essentially random value. CONCLUSIONS: Local energy terms
                  could be used safely to improve fold recognition algorithms.
                  To utilize pair interaction information, specially designed
                  pair potentials and/or a self-consistent description of pair
                  interactions is necessary.}

                  (microbiota) could affect acquisition of HIV or other
                  conditions, especially among MSM, we profiled the microbiota
                  of the anal canal, assessed its stability, and investigated
                  associations with diversity and composition. DESIGN:
                  Microbiota profiles in anal swabs collected from 76 MSM (52 in
                  1989, swab-1; 66 1-5 years later, swab-2) were compared by HIV
                  status (25 HIV-positive), T-cell subsets, and questionnaire
                  data. METHODS: Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified,
                  sequenced (Illumina MiSeq), and clustered into species-level
                  operational taxonomic units (QIIME and Greengenes). Regression
                  models and Wilcoxon tests were used for associations with
                  alpha diversity (unique operational taxonomic units, Shannon's
                  index). Composition was compared by Adonis (QIIME). RESULTS:
                  Most anal bacteria were Firmicutes (mean 60.6\%, range
                  21.1-91.1\%) or Bacteroidetes (29.4\%, 4.1-70.8\%). Alpha
                  diversity did not change between the two swabs (N = 42 pairs).
                  In swab-2, HIV-positives had lower alpha diversity (P â¤ 0.04)
                  and altered composition, with fewer Firmicutes and more
                  Fusobacteria taxa (P â¤ 0.03), not completely attributable to
                  very low CD4(+) cell count (median 232 cells/Î¼l), prior AIDS
                  clinical diagnosis (N = 17), or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
                  use (N = 6). Similar but weaker differences were observed in
                  swab-1 (HIV-positive median 580 CD4(+) cells/Î¼l; no
                  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Associations with T-cell
                  subsets, smoking, and sexual practices were null or
                  inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: The anal microbiota of MSM was
                  relatively stable over 1-5 years. However, with uncontrolled,
                  advanced HIV infection, the microbiota had altered composition
                  and reduced diversity partially attributable to antibiotics.
                  Investigations of microbial community associations with other
                  immune perturbations and clinical abnormalities are needed.}

                  structure and play a pivotal role in understanding folding,
                  function, evolution, and design. The advent of accurate
                  structure prediction techniques has resulted in an influx of
                  new structural data, making the partitioning of these
                  structures into domains essential for inferring evolutionary
                  relationships and functional classification. RESULTS: This
                  article presents Chainsaw, a supervised learning approach to
                  domain parsing that achieves accuracy that surpasses current
                  state-of-the-art methods. Chainsaw uses a fully convolutional
                  neural network which is trained to predict the probability
                  that each pair of residues is in the same domain. Domain
                  predictions are then derived from these pairwise predictions
                  using an algorithm that searches for the most likely
                  assignment of residues to domains given the set of pairwise
                  co-membership probabilities. Chainsaw matches CATH domain
                  annotations in 78\% of protein domains versus 72\% for the
                  next closest method. When predicting on AlphaFold models,
                  expert human evaluators were twice as likely to prefer
                  Chainsaw's predictions versus the next best method.

                  industries operate, provisioning major impact to modern
                  computing technologies because it is extra lightweight, highly
                  portable, energy, resource and storage efficient,
                  cost-effective, performance efficient, and extremely quick
                  during boot up. These often facilitate efficient load
                  balancing, low-level system maintenance, server consolidation
                  (for efficient energy and resource utilization) and
                  replication of instances over geographical locations for
                  better fault tolerance to escalate application reliability.
                  However, some recent literature have addressed various
                  challenges (such as complex networking, persistent storage
                  facilities, cross data centers and multicloud supports,
                  security issues, and lack of available, capable container
                  management APIs, etc.) regarding successful container adoption
                  in industries, which might have resulted in a seemingly meager
                  increase in industrial deployments of containerization over
                  the past few years despite bestowing efficient lightweight
                  virtualization. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of
                  containerizations along with their popularity dynamics has
                  still not been found in contemporary literature, which further
                  extends knowledge gap between developers and available
                  technologies. Hence, current study touches upon different
                  technicalities involved in containerization with potential
                  problems and possible solutions along with various important
                  industrial applications to manifest its existing supports and
                  technical hardships. Finally, we have conducted a
                  comprehensive experimental study to compare the performance of
                  VMs, containers and unikernels in terms of CPU utilization,
                  memory footprints, network bandwidth, execution time and
                  technological maturity using standard benchmarks and observed
                  containers to deliver satisfactory performance in almost all
                  aspects, however, are still not free from issues regarding
                  isolation \& security, performance stability, lack of
                  available efficient tools for crossplatform support and
                  persistent storage. Unikernels deliver good performance with
                  VM-like isolation but still need to achieve desired technical
                  maturity (in terms of microprocessor stability, process
                  containment, persistent storage, etc.). VMs, on the other
                  hand, are found to provide stable performance throughout,
                  though bigger memory footprints and slower spin up/down remain
                  their biggest weaknesses.}

                  method (ChainSaw) for identifying domains in multi-domain

                  not classified in CATH and AFDB structures from 21 model
                  organisms, expanding CATH by over 100\%. Domains not
                  classified in existing CATH superfamilies or fold groups were
                  used to seed novel folds, giving 253 new folds from PDB

                  functional annotations were obtained using (i) predictions
                  from publicly available methods (ii) annotations from
                  structural relatives in AFDB/UniProt50. We also predicted
                  functional sites and highly conserved residues. Some folds are

                  acclimation (in flowering plants), iron permease activity (in
                  fungi) and post-natal spermatogenesis (in mice).

                  Traditional approaches use a tabular structure (relational
                  databases) for storing data and thereby complicate storing and
                  retrieving interlinked data from the clinical domain. Graph
                  databases provide a great solution for this by storing data in
                  a graph as nodes (vertices) that are connected by edges
                  (links). The underlying graph structure can be used for the
                  subsequent data analysis (graph learning). Graph learning
                  consists of two parts: graph representation learning and graph
                  analytics. Graph representation learning aims to reduce
                  high-dimensional input graphs to low-dimensional
                  representations. Then, graph analytics uses the obtained
                  representations for analytical tasks like visualization,
                  classification, link prediction and clustering which can be
                  used to solve domain-specific problems. In this survey, we

                  heterogeneity of bacterial assemblages in our residential
                  environment remains limited. To investigate the existence of a
                  common core house dust bacterial microbiome we selected
                  household vacuum dusts, collected through a citizen science
                  approach, from homes across two bioclimatic regions (UK,
                  Oceanic/Maritime and Greece, Mediterranean). Following the
                  extraction of DNA from each dust sample, we targeted the
                  bacterial 16S rRNA gene using Illumina NextSeq sequencing.
                  PERMANOVA analysis of the microbial communities at family
                  level grouped samples within their distinct bioclimatic region
                  and SIMPER analysis at genus level identified the

                  Rhizobiaceae in the Greek samples. Our study highlights
                  citizen science as a powerful approach to access the indoor
                  residential environment, at scale, and establishes the
                  existence of a âcoreâ house dust microbiome independent of

                  convergence for structurally similar domains that lack
                  significant sequence similarity. Classic examples are the
                  OB-fold and SH3 domains, both small, modular beta-barrel
                  protein superfolds. The similarities among these domains have
                  variously been attributed to common descent or to convergent
                  evolution. Using a sequence profile-based phylogenetic
                  technique, we analyzed all structurally characterized OB-fold,
                  SH3, and PDZ domains with less than 40\% mutual sequence
                  identity. An all-against-all, profile-versus-profile analysis
                  of these domains revealed many previously undetectable
                  significant interrelationships. The matrices of scores were
                  used to infer phylogenies based on our derivation of the
                  relationships between sequence similarity E-values and
                  evolutionary distances. The resulting clades of domains
                  correlate remarkably well with biological function, as opposed
                  to structural similarity, indicating that the functionally
                  distinct sub-families within these superfolds are homologous.
                  This method extends phylogenetics into the challenging
                  âtwilight zoneâ of sequence similarity, providing the first

                  simultaneously satisfy the conflicting demands of completeness
                  on the one hand and quality of alignment and domain
                  definitions on the other. The latter properties are best dealt
                  with by manual approaches, whereas completeness in practice is
                  only amenable to automatic methods. Herein we present a
                  database based on hidden Markov model profiles (HMMs), which
                  combines high quality and completeness. Our database, Pfam,
                  consists of parts A and B. Pfam-A is curated and contains
                  well-characterized protein domain families with high quality
                  alignments, which are maintained by using manually checked
                  seed alignments and HMMs to find and align all members. Pfam-B
                  contains sequence families that were generated automatically
                  by applying the Domainer algorithm to cluster and align the
                  remaining protein sequences after removal of Pfam-A domains.
                  By using Pfam, a large number of previously unannotated
                  proteins from the Caenorhabditis elegans genome project were
                  classified. We have also identified many novel family
                  memberships in known proteins, including new kazal,
                  Fibronectin type III, and response regulator receiver domains.
                  Pfam-A families have permanent accession numbers and form a

                  mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the
                  animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it
                  is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large
                  introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits
                  from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together
                  with regions of three representative protein-coding genes
                  (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit
                  of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein).
                  Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher
                  percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal
                  markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success
                  eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode.
                  Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal
                  transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of
                  successful identification for the broadest range of fungi,
                  with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and
                  intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit,
                  a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior
                  species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early
                  diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was
                  otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal
                  small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS
                  will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal
                  barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with
                  the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed
                  for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.}

                  titled âWaste not, want not: why rarefying microbiome data is
                  inadmissible.â The claims of their study have significantly
                  altered how microbiome researchers control for the unavoidable
                  uneven sequencing depths that are inherent in modern 16S rRNA
                  gene sequencing. Confusion over the distinction between the
                  definitions of rarefying and rarefaction continues to cloud
                  the interpretation of their results. More importantly, the
                  authors made a variety of problematic choices when designing
                  and analyzing their simulations. I identified 11 factors that
                  could have compromised the results of the original study. I
                  reproduced the original simulation results and assessed the
                  impact of those factors on the underlying conclusion that
                  rarefying data is inadmissible. Throughout, the design of the
                  original study made choices that caused rarefying and
                  rarefaction to appear to perform worse than they truly did.
                  Most important were the approaches used to assess ecological
                  distances, the removal of samples with low sequencing depth,
                  and not accounting for conditions where sequencing effort is
                  confounded with treatment group. Although the original study
                  criticized rarefying for the arbitrary removal of valid data,
                  repeatedly rarefying data many times (i.e., rarefaction)
                  incorporates all the data. In contrast, it is the removal of
                  rare taxa that would appear to remove valid data. Overall, I
                  show that rarefaction is the most robust approach to control
                  for uneven sequencing effort when considered across a variety
                  of alpha and beta diversity metrics.IMPORTANCEOver the past 10
                  years, the best method for normalizing the sequencing depth of
                  samples characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been
                  contentious. An often cited article by McMurdie and Holmes
                  forcefully argued that rarefying the number of sequence counts
                  was âinadmissibleâ and should not be employed. However, I
                  identified a number of problems with the design of their
                  simulations and analysis that compromised their results. In
                  fact, when I reproduced and expanded upon their analysis, it
                  was clear that rarefaction was actually the most robust
                  approach for controlling for uneven sequencing effort across
                  samples. Rarefaction limits the rate of falsely detecting and
                  rejecting differences between treatment groups. Far from being
                  âinadmissibleâ, rarefaction is a valuable tool for analyzing
                  microbiome sequence data.},

                  diseases, a group of diseases in which arteries become
                  occluded with atheromas that may rupture, leading to different
                  cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or
                  ischemic stroke. There is a large body of epidemiologic and
                  animal model evidence associating periodontitis with
                  atherosclerotic disease, and many potential mechanisms linking
                  these diseases have been elucidated. This chapter will update
                  knowledge on these mechanisms, which generally fall into 2
                  categories: microbial invasion and infection of atheromas; and
                  inflammatory and immunologic. With respect to the invasion and
                  infection of atheromas, it is well established that organisms
                  from the subgingival biofilm can enter the circulation and
                  lodge in most distant tissues. Bacteremias resulting from oral
                  interventions, and even oral hygiene activities, are well
                  documented. More recently, indirect routes of entry of oral
                  organisms (via phagocytes or dendritic cells) have been
                  described for many oral organisms, into many tissues. Such
                  organisms include the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas
                  gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella
                  intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
                  Intracellular survival of these organisms with dissemination
                  to distant sites (The Trojan Horse approach) has been
                  described. Their relative contribution to atheroma formation
                  and progression has been studied mainly in experimental
                  research, with results demonstrating that these organisms can
                  invade endothelial cells and phagocytic cells within the
                  atheroma, leading to pathogenic changes and progression of the
                  atheroma lesion. The second category of mechanisms potentially
                  linking periodontitis to atherosclerosis includes the dumping
                  of inflammatory mediators originating from periodontal lesions
                  into the systemic circulation. These inflammatory mediators,
                  such as C-reactive protein, matrix metalloproteinases,
                  fibrinogen, and other hemostatic factors, would further
                  accelerate atheroma formation and progression, mainly through
                  oxidative stress and inflammatory dysfunction. Moreover,
                  direct effects on lipid oxidation have also been described. In
                  summary, the evidence supports the concept that periodontitis
                  enhances the levels of systemic mediators of inflammation that
                  are risk factors for atherosclerotic diseases.}

                  of data in a variety of forms. Although they grant significant
                  insights into diagnosis and treatment, implementing data
                  exploration into current medical databases is challenging
                  since these are often based on a relational schema and cannot
                  be used to easily extract information for cohort analysis and
                  visualization. As a consequence, valuable information
                  regarding cohort distribution or patient similarity may be
                  missed. With the rapid advancement of biomedical technologies,
                  new forms of data from methods such as Next Generation
                  Sequencing (NGS) or chromosome microarray (array CGH) are
                  constantly being generated; hence it can be expected that the
                  amount and complexity of medical data will rise and bring
                  relational database systems to a limit. DESCRIPTION: We
                  present Graph4Med, a web application that relies on a graph
                  database obtained by transforming a relational database.
                  Graph4Med provides a straightforward visualization and
                  analysis of a selected patient cohort. Our use case is a
                  database of pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).
                  Along routine patients' health records it also contains
                  results of latest technologies such as NGS data. We developed
                  a suitable graph data schema to convert the relational data
                  into a graph data structure and store it in Neo4j. We used
                  NeoDash to build a dashboard for querying and displaying
                  patients' cohort analysis. This way our tool (1) quickly
                  displays the overview of patients' cohort information such as
                  distributions of gender, age, mutations (fusions), diagnosis;
                  (2) provides mutation (fusion) based similarity search and
                  display in a maneuverable graph; (3) generates an interactive
                  graph of any selected patient and facilitates the
                  identification of interesting patterns among patients.
                  CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a
                  graph database for storing and querying medical databases. Our
                  dashboard allows a fast and interactive analysis and
                  visualization of complex medical data. It is especially useful
                  for patients similarity search based on mutations (fusions),
                  of which vast amounts of data have been generated by NGS in
                  recent years. It can discover relationships and patterns in
                  patients cohorts that are normally hard to grasp. Expanding
                  Graph4Med to more medical databases will bring novel insights
                  into diagnostic and research.},

               account for 50\% of the dry mass of cells and play a role in
               everything an organism does. There are many different types of
               proteins. Different proteins can play a role in speeding up
               chemical reactions, storage, defense, cell communication,
               movement, and structural support. Humans have tens of thousands
               of proteins in their bodies at any moment. Each of these proteins
               has its structure and function. They are known as the most
               structurally complicated biological molecules. As diverse as they
               can be, they are all made up of the same 20 amino acids. Large
               polypeptide chains can be created by forming peptide bonds
               between the amino and carboxyl groups on 2 different amino acids.
               Every protein can be described according to its primary,
               secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. In brief, the
               primary structure is the linear chain of amino acids. The
               secondary structure comprises regions stabilized by hydrogen
               bonds between atoms in the polypeptide backbone. Tertiary
               structure is the protein's 3-dimensional shape determined by
               regions stabilized by interactions between the side chains.
               Quaternary structure is the association between 2 or more
               polypeptides, but not every protein has a quaternary structure.}

                  closest relative and assign domain boundaries. To increase the
                  fidelity of the assignments, a support vector machine is used
                  to provide an optimal scoring scheme. Once a domain is
                  verified, it is excised, and the search protocol is repeated
                  in an iterative fashion until all recognisable domains have
                  been identified. We have performed an initial benchmark of
                  CATHEDRAL against other publicly available structure
                  comparison methods using a consensus dataset of domains
                  derived from the CATH and SCOP domain classifications.
                  CATHEDRAL shows superior performance in fold recognition and
                  alignment accuracy when compared with many equivalent methods.
                  If a novel multidomain structure contains a known fold,
                  CATHEDRAL will locate it in 90\% of cases, with Â¡1\% false
                  positives. For nearly 80\% of assigned domains in a manually
                  validated test set, the boundaries were correctly delineated
                  within a tolerance of ten residues. For the remaining cases,
                  previously classified domains were very remotely related to
                  the query chain so that embellishments to the core of the fold
                  caused significant differences in domain sizes and manual
                  refinement of the boundaries was necessary. To put this
                  performance in context, a well-established sequence method
                  based on hidden Markov models was only able to detect 65\% of
                  domains, with 33\% of the subsequent boundaries assigned
                  within ten residues. Since, on average, 50\% of newly
                  determined protein structures contain more than one domain
                  unit, and typically 90\% or more of these domains are already
                  classified in CATH, CATHEDRAL will considerably facilitate the
                  automation of protein structure classification.}

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) is
                  the major pathogen that causes the acquired immune deficiency
                  syndrome (AIDS). With the availability of large-scale
                  protein-protein interaction (PPI) measurements, comparative
                  network analysis can provide a promising way to study the
                  host-virus interactions and their functional significance in
                  the pathogenesis of AIDS. Until now, there have been a large
                  number of HIV studies based on various animal models. In this
                  paper, we present a novel framework for studying the host-HIV
                  interactions through comparative network analysis across
                  different species. RESULTS: Based on the proposed framework,
                  we test our hypothesis that HIV-1 attacks essential biological
                  pathways that are conserved across species. We selected the
                  Homo sapiens and Mus musculus PPI networks with the largest
                  coverage among the PPI networks that are available from public
                  databases. By using a local network alignment algorithm based
                  on hidden Markov models (HMMs), we first identified the
                  pathways that are conserved in both networks. Next, we
                  analyzed the HIV-1 susceptibility of these pathways, in
                  comparison with random pathways in the human PPI network. Our
                  analysis shows that the conserved pathways have a
                  significantly higher probability of being intercepted by
                  HIV-1. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
                  shows that most of the enriched GO terms are related to signal
                  transduction, which has been conjectured to be one of the
                  major mechanisms targeted by HIV-1 for the takeover of the
                  host cell. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study clearly
                  shows that the comparative analysis of PPI networks across
                  different species can provide important insights into the
                  host-HIV interactions and the detailed mechanisms of HIV-1. We
                  expect that comparative multiple network analysis of various
                  species that have different levels of susceptibility to
                  similar lentiviruses may provide a very effective framework
                  for generating novel, and experimentally verifiable hypotheses
                  on the mechanisms of HIV-1. We believe that the proposed
                  framework has the potential to expedite the elucidation of the
                  important mechanisms of HIV-1, and ultimately, the discovery
                  of novel anti-HIV drugs.}

                  generally improved using coevolution derived residue-residue
                  contact information as restraints during Rosetta
                  conformational sampling and refinement, particularly when the
                  number of sequences in the family was more than three times
                  the length of the protein. The highlight was the human
                  assisted prediction of T0806, a large and topologically
                  complex target with no homologs of known structure, which had

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Protein evolution gives rise to families of
                  structurally related proteins, within which sequence
                  identities can be extremely low. As a result, structure-based
                  classifications can be effective at identifying unanticipated
                  relationships in known structures and in optimal cases
                  function can also be assigned. The ever increasing number of
                  known protein structures is too large to classify all proteins
                  manually, therefore, automatic methods are needed for fast
                  evaluation of protein structures. RESULTS: We present a
                  semi-automatic procedure for deriving a novel hierarchical
                  classification of protein domain structures (CATH). The four
                  main levels of our classification are protein class (C),
                  architecture (A), topology (T) and homologous superfamily (H).
                  Class is the simplest level, and it essentially describes the
                  secondary structure composition of each domain. In contrast,
                  architecture summarises the shape revealed by the orientations
                  of the secondary structure units, such as barrels and
                  sandwiches. At the topology level, sequential connectivity is
                  considered, such that members of the same architecture might
                  have quite different topologies. When structures belonging to
                  the same T-level have suitably high similarities combined with
                  similar functions, the proteins are assumed to be
                  evolutionarily related and put into the same homologous
                  superfamily. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the structural families
                  generated by CATH reveals the prominent features of protein
                  structure space. We find that nearly a third of the homologous
                  superfamilies (H-levels) belong to ten major T-levels, which
                  we call superfolds, and furthermore that nearly two-thirds of
                  these H-levels cluster into nine simple architectures. A
                  database of well-characterised protein structure families,
                  such as CATH, will facilitate the assignment of
                  structure-function/evolution relationships to both known and
                  newly determined protein structures.}

                  PCR amplification of all or part of the gene for the 16S rRNA
                  subunit, which serves as a biomarker for identifying and
                  quantifying the various taxa present in a microbiome sample.
                  Several computational methods exist for analyzing 16S amplicon
                  sequencing. However, the most-used bioinformatics tools cannot
                  produce high quality genus-level or species-level taxonomic
                  calls and may underestimate the potential accuracy of these
                  calls. We used 16S sequencing data from mock bacterial
                  communities to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of
                  several bioinformatics pipelines and genomic reference
                  libraries used for microbiome analyses, concentrating on
                  measuring the accuracy of species-level taxonomic assignments
                  of 16S amplicon reads. We evaluated the tools DADA2, QIIME 2,
                  Mothur, PathoScope 2, and Kraken 2 in conjunction with
                  reference libraries from Greengenes, SILVA, Kraken 2, and
                  RefSeq. Profiling tools were compared using publicly available
                  mock community data from several sources, comprising 136
                  samples with varied species richness and evenness, several
                  different amplified regions within the 16S rRNA gene, and both
                  DNA spike-ins and cDNA from collections of plated cells.
                  PathoScope 2 and Kraken 2, both tools designed for
                  whole-genome metagenomics, outperformed DADA2, QIIME 2 using
                  the DADA2 plugin, and Mothur, which are theoretically
                  specialized for 16S analyses. Evaluations of reference
                  libraries identified the SILVA and RefSeq/Kraken 2 Standard
                  libraries as superior in accuracy compared to Greengenes.
                  These findings support PathoScope and Kraken 2 as fully
                  capable, competitive options for genus- and species-level 16S

                  closely associated with the progression of inflammatory bowel
                  disease (IBD). However, inconsistent findings across studies
                  impede a comprehensive understanding of their roles in IBD and
                  their potential as reliable diagnostic biomarkers. To address
                  this challenge, here we comprehensively analyze 9 metagenomic
                  and 4 metabolomics cohorts of IBD from different populations.
                  Through cross-cohort integrative analysis (CCIA), we identify
                  a consistent characteristic of commensal gut microbiota.
                  Especially, three bacteria, namely Asaccharobacter celatus,
                  Gemmiger formicilis, and Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum, which
                  are rarely reported in IBD. Metagenomic functional analysis
                  reveals that essential gene of Two-component system pathway,
                  linked to fecal calprotectin, are implicated in IBD.
                  Metabolomics analysis shows 36 identified metabolites with
                  significant differences, while the roles of these metabolites
                  in IBD are still unknown. To further elucidate the
                  relationship between gut microbiota and metabolites, we
                  construct multi-omics biological correlation (MOBC) maps,
                  which highlights gut microbial biotransformation deficiencies
                  and significant alterations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.
                  Finally, we identify multi-omics biomarkers for IBD diagnosis,
                  validated across multiple global cohorts (AUROC values ranging
                  from 0.92 to 0.98). Our results offer valuable insights and a
                  significant resource for developing mechanistic hypotheses on
                  host-microbiome interactions in IBD.}

                  homology models that are frequently more accurate than their
                  templates. We test this method by building complete-chain
                  models for a benchmark set of 22 proteins, each with 1 or 2
                  candidate templates, for a total of 39 test cases. We use
                  structure-based and sequence-based alignments for each of the
                  test cases. All atoms, including hydrogens, are represented
                  explicitly. The resulting models contain approximately the
                  same number of atomic overlaps as experimentally determined
                  crystal structures and maintain good stereochemistry. The most
                  accurate models can be identified by their energies, and in 22
                  of 39 cases a model that is more accurate than the template
                  over aligned regions is one of the 10 lowest-energy models.}

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 5\% of Pfam families are enzymatic,
                  but only a small fraction of the sequences within these
                  families (Â¡0.5\%) have had the residues responsible for
                  catalysis determined. To increase the active site annotations
                  in the Pfam database, we have developed a strict set of rules,
                  chosen to reduce the rate of false positives, which enable the
                  transfer of experimentally determined active site residue data
                  to other sequences within the same Pfam family. DESCRIPTION:
                  We have created a large database of predicted active site
                  residues. On comparing our active site predictions to those
                  found in UniProtKB, Catalytic Site Atlas, PROSITE and MEROPS
                  we find that we make many novel predictions. On investigating
                  the small subset of predictions made by these databases that
                  are not predicted by us, we found these sequences did not meet
                  our strict criteria for prediction. We assessed the
                  sensitivity and specificity of our methodology and estimate
                  that only 3\% of our predicted sequences are false positives.
                  CONCLUSION: We have predicted 606110 active site residues, of
                  which 94\% are not found in UniProtKB, and have increased the
                  active site annotations in Pfam by more than 200 fold.
                  Although implemented for Pfam, the tool we have developed for
                  transferring the data can be applied to any alignment with
                  associated experimental active site data and is available for
                  download. Our active site predictions are re-calculated at
                  each Pfam release to ensure they are comprehensive and up to
                  date. They provide one of the largest available databases of
                  active site annotation.}

                  is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently
                  historical reasons, the common approach is either to use
                  simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity)
                  or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these
                  approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially
                  abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is
                  available that simultaneously accounts for library size
                  differences and biological variability using an appropriate
                  mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA
                  sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model
                  for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R
                  packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the
                  supporting statistical theory and use simulations and
                  empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements
                  provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple
                  proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and
                  rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in
                  tests for species that are differentially abundant across
                  sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering,
                  we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards
                  samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative
                  methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial
                  methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian
                  mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We
                  find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an
                  adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless
                  tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these
                  results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate
                  that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have
                  provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the
                  R package, phyloseq.}

                  tables with associated sample and observation metadata. As the
                  number of categories of comparative omics data types
                  (collectively, the âome-omeâ) grows rapidly, a general format
                  to represent and archive this data will facilitate the
                  interoperability of existing bioinformatics tools and future
                  meta-analyses. FINDINGS: The BIOM file format is supported by
                  an independent open-source software project (the biom-format
                  project), which initially contains Python objects that support
                  the use and manipulation of BIOM data in Python programs, and
                  is intended to be an open development effort where developers
                  can submit implementations of these objects in other
                  programming languages. CONCLUSIONS: The BIOM file format and
                  the biom-format project are steps toward reducing the
                  âbioinformatics bottleneckâ that is currently being
                  experienced in diverse areas of biological sciences, and will
                  help us move toward the next phase of comparative omics where
                  basic science is translated into clinical and environmental
                  applications. The BIOM file format is currently recognized as

                  few control the rate of this reaction and the metabolic
                  pathway that follows. One specific mechanism for such
                  enzymatic control of a metabolic pathway involves molecular
                  feedback, whereby a metabolite further down the pathway acts
                  at a unique site on the control enzyme to alter its activity
                  allosterically. This regulation may be positive or negative
                  (or both), depending upon the particular system. Another
                  method of enzymatic control involves the cooperative binding
                  of the substrate, which allows a large change in enzyme
                  activity to emanate from only a small change in substrate
                  concentration. Allosteric regulation and homotropic
                  cooperativity are often known to involve significant
                  conformational changes in the structure of the protein.
                  Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) is the
                  textbook example of an enzyme that regulates a metabolic
                  pathway, namely, pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, by
                  feedback control and by the cooperative binding of the
                  substrate, L-aspartate. The catalytic and regulatory
                  mechanisms of this enzyme have been extensively studied. A
                  series of X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme in the
                  presence and absence of substrates, products, and analogues
                  have provided details, at the molecular level, of the
                  conformational changes that the enzyme undergoes as it shifts
                  between its low-activity, low-affinity form (T state) to its
                  high-activity, high-affinity form (R state). These structural
                  data provide insights into not only how this enzyme catalyzes
                  the reaction between l-aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to
                  form N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate, but also
                  how the allosteric effectors modulate this activity. In this
                  Account, we summarize studies on the structure of the enzyme
                  and describe how these structural data provide insights into
                  the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the enzyme. The
                  ATCase-catalyzed reaction is regulated by nucleotide binding
                  some 60 Ã from the active site, inducing structural
                  alterations that modulate catalytic activity. The delineation
                  of the structure and function in this particular model system
                  will help in understanding the molecular basis of
                  cooperativity and allosteric regulation in other systems as

                  analysis of microbiome data is the bias introduced by
                  differences in the sampling fractions across samples. We
                  introduce a methodology called Analysis of Compositions of

                  the unknown sampling fractions and corrects the bias induced

                  high occupant density across the globe, and identifying
                  factors shaping public transit air microbiomes will help
                  design strategies to minimize the transmission of pathogens.
                  However, the majority of microbiome works dedicated to the
                  public transit air are limited to amplicon sequencing, and our
                  knowledge regarding the functional potentials and the
                  repertoire of resistance genes (i.e. resistome) is limited.
                  Furthermore, current air microbiome investigations on public
                  transit systems are focused on single cities, and a multi-city
                  assessment of the public transit air microbiome will allow a
                  greater understanding of whether and how broad environmental,
                  building, and anthropogenic factors shape the public transit
                  air microbiome in an international scale. Therefore, in this
                  study, the public transit air microbiomes and resistomes of
                  six cities across three continents (Denver, Hong Kong, London,
                  New York City, Oslo, Stockholm) were characterized. RESULTS:
                  City was the sole factor associated with public transit air
                  microbiome differences, with diverse taxa identified as
                  drivers for geography-associated functional potentials,
                  concomitant with geographical differences in species- and
                  strain-level inferred growth profiles. Related bacterial
                  strains differed among cities in genes encoding resistance,
                  transposase, and other functions. Sourcetracking estimated
                  that human skin, soil, and wastewater were major presumptive
                  resistome sources of public transit air, and adjacent public
                  transit surfaces may also be considered presumptive sources.
                  Large proportions of detected resistance genes were co-located
                  with mobile genetic elements including plasmids. Biosynthetic
                  gene clusters and city-unique coding sequences were found in
                  the metagenome-assembled genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
                  geographical specificity transcends multiple aspects of the
                  public transit air microbiome, and future efforts on a global
                  scale are warranted to increase our understanding of factors
                  shaping the microbiome of this unique built environment.},

                  any computational task in a standardized and reliable way is
                  presented and metrics to contextualize GHG emissions are
                  defined. A freely available online tool, Green Algorithms

                  Core components are rigorous blind testing of methods and

                  rivaling the corresponding experimental ones in accuracy. In
                  this sense, the results represent a solution to the classical
                  protein-folding problem, at least for single proteins. The

                  been solved to 2.5 A. Ten rounds of model building and 123
                  cycles of restrained reciprocal space refinement have resulted
                  in a model containing 94.4\% of the theoretical atoms of the
                  protein-inhibitor complex with an R-factor of 0.231. The fit
                  of the model to the density is excellent, except for
                  occasional side-chains and two sections of the regulatory
                  chains that may be disordered. The electron density for the
                  PALA molecule is readily identifiable for both catalytic (c)
                  chains of the asymmetric unit and bonding interactions with
                  several important residues including Ser52, Arg54, Thr55,
                  Ser80, Lys84, Arg105, His134, Arg165, Arg229 and Gln231 are
                  apparent. The carboxylate groups of the PALA molecule are in a
                  nearly cis conformation. Gross quaternary changes between the
                  T and R forms are noted and in agreement with earlier work
                  from this laboratory. Namely, in the new structure the
                  catalytic trimers move apart by 12 A along the 3-fold axis of
                  the enzyme and relocate by 10 degrees relative to each other,
                  adopting a more eclipsed position. The regulatory (r) chains
                  in the new structure reorient about their 2-fold axis by 15
                  degrees. Large tertiary changes that include domain migration
                  and rearrangement are also present between these two forms. In
                  the R form both domains of the catalytic chain relocate closer
                  to each other in order to bind to the inhibitor. The polar
                  domain seems to bind primarily to the carbamoyl phosphate
                  moiety of PALA, and the equatorial domain binds primarily to
                  the L-aspartate moiety. Other changes in tertiary structure
                  bring the 80s loop (from an adjacent catalytic chain) and the
                  240s loop into a position to interact with the PALA molecule.
                  Changes have been searched for in all interface regions of the
                  enzyme. While the C1-C4 and C1-R4 regions have been completely
                  altered, most of the other interchain interfaces are similar
                  in the T and R forms. The intrachain interfaces, between
                  domains of the same catalytic chains, have undergone some
                  reorganization as these domains move closer to each other when
                  the inhibitor is bound. This new structure allows a
                  reinterpretation of genetic and chemical modification studies

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Differential expression analysis on the basis of
                  RNA-Seq count data has become a standard tool in
                  transcriptomics. Several studies have shown that prior
                  normalization of the data is crucial for a reliable detection
                  of transcriptional differences. Until now it has not been
                  clear whether and how the transcriptomic approach can be used
                  for differential expression analysis in metatranscriptomics.
                  METHODS: We propose a model for differential expression in
                  metatranscriptomics that explicitly accounts for variations in
                  the taxonomic composition of transcripts across different
                  samples. As a main consequence the correct normalization of
                  metatranscriptomic count data under this model requires the
                  taxonomic separation of the data into organism-specific bins.
                  Then the taxon-specific scaling of organism profiles yields a
                  valid normalization and allows us to recombine the scaled
                  profiles into a metatranscriptomic count matrix. This matrix
                  can then be analyzed with statistical tools for transcriptomic
                  count data. For taxon-specific scaling and recombination of
                  scaled counts we provide a simple R script. RESULTS: When
                  applying transcriptomic tools for differential expression
                  analysis directly to metatranscriptomic data with an
                  organism-independent (global) scaling of counts the resulting
                  differences may be difficult to interpret. The differences may
                  correspond to changing functional profiles of the contributing
                  organisms but may also result from a variation of taxonomic
                  abundances. Taxon-specific scaling eliminates this variation
                  and therefore the resulting differences actually reflect a
                  different behavior of organisms under changing conditions. In
                  simulation studies we show that the divergence between results
                  from global and taxon-specific scaling can be drastic. In
                  particular, the variation of organism abundances can imply a
                  considerable increase of significant differences with global
                  scaling. Also, on real metatranscriptomic data, the
                  predictions from taxon-specific and global scaling can differ
                  widely. Our studies indicate that in real data applications
                  performed with global scaling it might be impossible to
                  distinguish between differential expression in terms of
                  transcriptomic changes and differential composition in terms
                  of changing taxonomic proportions. CONCLUSIONS: As in
                  transcriptomics, a proper normalization of count data is also
                  essential for differential expression analysis in
                  metatranscriptomics. Our model implies a taxon-specific
                  scaling of counts for normalization of the data. The
                  application of taxon-specific scaling consequently removes
                  taxonomic composition variations from functional profiles and
                  therefore provides a clear interpretation of the observed
                  functional differences.},

                  protection even today1. The asthma-protective effect of farms
                  appears to be associated with rich home dust microbiota2,3,
                  which could be used to model a health-promoting indoor
                  microbiome. Here we show by modeling differences in house dust
                  microbiota composition between farm and non-farm homes of
                  Finnish birth cohorts4 that in children who grow up in
                  non-farm homes, asthma risk decreases as the similarity of
                  their home bacterial microbiota composition to that of farm
                  homes increases. The protective microbiota had a low abundance
                  of Streptococcaceae relative to outdoor-associated bacterial
                  taxa. The protective effect was independent of richness and
                  total bacterial load and was associated with reduced
                  proinflammatory cytokine responses against bacterial cell wall
                  components ex vivo. We were able to reproduce these findings
                  in a study among rural German children2 and showed that
                  children living in German non-farm homes with an indoor
                  microbiota more similar to Finnish farm homes have decreased
                  asthma risk. The indoor dust microbiota composition appears to
                  be a definable, reproducible predictor of asthma risk and a
                  potential modifiable target for asthma prevention.}

                  structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been
                  determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the
                  billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is
                  bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort
                  required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate
                  computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to
                  enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the
                  three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based
                  solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction
                  component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an
                  important open research problem for more than 50 years9.
                  Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short
                  of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is
                  available. Here we provide the first computational method that
                  can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy
                  even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We
                  validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Metatranscriptomics is emerging as a powerful
                  technology for the functional characterization of complex
                  microbial communities (microbiomes). Use of unbiased
                  RNA-sequencing can reveal both the taxonomic composition and
                  active biochemical functions of a complex microbial community.
                  However, the lack of established reference genomes,
                  computational tools and pipelines make analysis and
                  interpretation of these datasets challenging. Systematic
                  studies that compare data across microbiomes are needed to
                  demonstrate the ability of such pipelines to deliver
                  biologically meaningful insights on microbiome function.
                  RESULTS: Here, we apply a standardized analytical pipeline to
                  perform a comparative analysis of metatranscriptomic data from
                  diverse microbial communities derived from mouse large
                  intestine, cow rumen, kimchi culture, deep-sea thermal vent
                  and permafrost. Sequence similarity searches allowed
                  annotation of 19 to 76\% of putative messenger RNA (mRNA)
                  reads, with the highest frequency in the kimchi dataset due to
                  its relatively low complexity and availability of closely
                  related reference genomes. Metatranscriptomic datasets
                  exhibited distinct taxonomic and functional signatures. From a
                  metabolic perspective, we identified a common core of enzymes
                  involved in amino acid, energy and nucleotide metabolism and
                  also identified microbiome-specific pathways such as
                  phosphonate metabolism (deep sea) and glycan degradation
                  pathways (cow rumen). Integrating taxonomic and functional
                  annotations within a novel visualization framework revealed
                  the contribution of different taxa to metabolic pathways,
                  allowing the identification of taxa that contribute unique
                  functions. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a single, standard
                  pipeline confirms that the rich taxonomic and functional
                  diversity observed across microbiomes is not simply an
                  artefact of different analysis pipelines but instead reflects
                  distinct environmental influences. At the same time, our
                  findings show how microbiome complexity and availability of
                  reference genomes can impact comprehensive annotation of
                  metatranscriptomes. Consequently, beyond the application of
                  standardized pipelines, additional caution must be taken when
                  interpreting their output and performing downstream,
                  microbiome-specific, analyses. The pipeline used in these
                  analyses along with a tutorial has been made freely available

                  microbial organisms has improved steadily over the past
                  decade, but there is still room for improvement. Increasing
                  the number of correct identifications, both of genes and of
                  the translation initiation sites for each gene, and reducing
                  the overall number of false positives, are all desirable
                  goals. RESULTS: With our years of experience in manually
                  curating genomes for the Joint Genome Institute, we developed
                  a new gene prediction algorithm called Prodigal (PROkaryotic
                  DYnamic programming Gene-finding ALgorithm). With Prodigal, we
                  focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene
                  structure prediction, improved translation initiation site
                  recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the
                  results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to
                  demonstrate that it met each of these objectives. CONCLUSION:
                  We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction
                  program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/.
                  Prodigal achieved good results compared to existing methods,
                  and we believe it will be a valuable asset to automated
                  microbial annotation pipelines.}

                  been developed to introduce some order to the large amount of
                  data present in the Protein Data Bank. Such methods facilitate
                  structural comparisons and provide a greater understanding of
                  structure and function. The most widely used and comprehensive
                  databases are SCOP, CATH and FSSP, which represent three
                  unique methods of classifying protein structures: purely
                  manual, a combination of manual and automated, and purely
                  automated, respectively. In order to develop reliable template
                  libraries and benchmarks for protein-fold recognition, a
                  systematic comparison of these databases has been carried out
                  to determine their overall agreement in classifying protein
                  structures. RESULTS: Approximately two-thirds of the protein
                  chains in each database are common to all three databases.
                  Despite employing different methods, and basing their systems
                  on different rules of protein structure and taxonomy, SCOP,
                  CATH and FSSP agree on the majority of their classifications.
                  Discrepancies and inconsistencies are accounted for by a small
                  number of explanations. Other interesting features have been
                  identified, and various differences between manual and
                  automatic classification methods are presented. CONCLUSIONS:
                  Using these databases requires an understanding of the rules
                  upon which they are based; each method offers certain
                  advantages depending on the biological requirements and
                  knowledge of the user. The degree of discrepancy between the
                  systems also has an impact on reliability of prediction
                  methods that employ these schemes as benchmarks. To generate
                  accurate fold templates for threading, we extract information
                  from a consensus database, encompassing agreements between
                  SCOP, CATH and FSSP.}

                  an exhaustive analysis, we conclude that between 0.4 and 4\%
                  of sequences are involved in convergent evolution of domain
                  architectures, and expect the actual number to be close to the
                  lower bound. We also made two incidental observations, albeit
                  on a small sample: the events leading to convergent evolution
                  appear to be random with no functional or structural
                  preferences, and changes in the number of tandem repeat
                  domains occur more readily than changes which alter the domain
                  composition. CONCLUSION: The principal conclusion is that the
                  observed domain architectures of the sequences in the genomes
                  are driven by evolutionary descent rather than functional
                  necessity. CONTACT: gough@supfam.org.}

                  perform with greater selectively than those that use pairwise
                  comparisons. Of the profile methods, hidden Markov models
                  (HMMs) are apparently the best. The first part of this paper
                  describes calculations that (i) improve the performance of
                  HMMs and (ii) determine a good procedure for creating HMMs for
                  sequences of proteins of known structure. For a family of
                  related proteins, more homologues are detected using multiple
                  models built from diverse single seed sequences than from one
                  model built from a good alignment of those sequences. A new
                  procedure is described for detecting and correcting those
                  errors that arise at the model-building stage of the
                  procedure. These two improvements greatly increase selectivity
                  and coverage. The second part of the paper describes the
                  construction of a library of HMMs, called SUPERFAMILY, that
                  represent essentially all proteins of known structure. The
                  sequences of the domains in proteins of known structure, that
                  have identities less than 95 \%, are used as seeds to build
                  the models. Using the current data, this gives a library with
                  4894 models. The third part of the paper describes the use of
                  the SUPERFAMILY model library to annotate the sequences of
                  over 50 genomes. The models match twice as many target
                  sequences as are matched by pairwise sequence comparison
                  methods. For each genome, close to half of the sequences are
                  matched in all or in part and, overall, the matches cover 35
                  \% of eukaryotic genomes and 45 \% of bacterial genomes. On
                  average roughly 15\% of genome sequences are labelled as being
                  hypothetical yet homologous to proteins of known structure.
                  The annotations derived from these matches are available from
                  a public web server at:
                  http://stash.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY. This server also
                  enables users to match their own sequences against the
                  SUPERFAMILY model library.}

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: One method for rejuvenating land polluted with
                  anthropogenic contaminants is through phytoremediation, the
                  reclamation of land through the cultivation of specific crops.
                  The capacity for phytoremediation crops, such as Salix spp.,
                  to tolerate and even flourish in contaminated soils relies on
                  a highly complex and predominantly cryptic interacting
                  community of microbial life. METHODS: Here, Illumina HiSeq
                  2500 sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly were used
                  to observe gene expression in washed Salix purpurea cv. 'Fish
                  Creek' roots from trees pot grown in petroleum
                  hydrocarbon-contaminated or non-contaminated soil. All 189,849
                  assembled contigs were annotated without a priori assumption
                  as to sequence origin and differential expression was
                  assessed. RESULTS: The 839 contigs differentially expressed
                  (DE) and annotated from S. purpurea revealed substantial
                  increases in transcripts encoding abiotic stress response
                  equipment, such as glutathione S-transferases, in roots of
                  contaminated trees as well as the hallmarks of fungal
                  interaction, such as SWEET2 (Sugars Will Eventually Be
                  Exported Transporter). A total of 8252 DE transcripts were
                  fungal in origin, with contamination conditions resulting in a
                  community shift from Ascomycota to Basidiomycota genera. In
                  response to contamination, 1745 Basidiomycota transcripts
                  increased in abundance (the majority uniquely expressed in
                  contaminated soil) including major monosaccharide transporter
                  MST1, primary cell wall and lamella CAZy enzymes, and an
                  ectomycorrhiza-upregulated exo-Î²-1,3-glucanase (GH5).
                  Additionally, 639 DE polycistronic transcripts from an
                  uncharacterised Enterobacteriaceae species were uniformly in
                  higher abundance in contamination conditions and comprised a
                  wide spectrum of genes cryptic under laboratory conditions but
                  considered putatively involved in eukaryotic interaction,
                  biofilm formation and dioxygenase hydrocarbon degradation.
                  CONCLUSIONS: Fungal gene expression, representing the majority
                  of contigs assembled, suggests out-competition of white rot
                  Ascomycota genera (dominated by Pyronema), a sometimes
                  ectomycorrhizal (ECM) Ascomycota (Tuber) and ECM Basidiomycota
                  (Hebeloma) by a poorly characterised putative ECM
                  Basidiomycota due to contamination. Root and fungal expression
                  involved transcripts encoding carbohydrate/amino acid (C/N)
                  dialogue whereas bacterial gene expression included the
                  apparatus necessary for biofilm interaction and direct
                  reduction of contamination stress, a potential bacterial
                  currency for a role in tripartite mutualism. Unmistakable
                  within the metatranscriptome is the degree to which the
                  landscape of rhizospheric biology, particularly the important
                  but predominantly uncharacterised fungal genetics, is yet to
                  be discovered.},

                  depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass, due to their high
                  functional diversity and adaptability. To achieve the full
                  microbial exploitation of lignocellulosic residues and the

                  multiple metabolic pathways and enzymes of various
                  specificities are required. In this work, highly diverse
                  aerobic, mesophilic bacteria enriched from Keri Lake, a
                  pristine marsh of increased biomass degradation and natural
                  underground oil leaks, were explored for their metabolic
                  versatility and enzymatic potential towards lignocellulosic
                  substrates. A high number of Pseudomonas species, obtained
                  from enrichment cultures where organosolv lignin served as the
                  sole carbon and energy source, were able to assimilate a range
                  of lignin-associated aromatic compounds. Comparatively more
                  complex bacterial consortia, including members of
                  Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacilli, Sphingobacteria, and
                  Flavobacteria, were also enriched from cultures with xylan or
                  carboxymethyl cellulose as sole carbon sources. Numerous
                  individual isolates could target diverse structural
                  lignocellulose polysaccharides by expressing hydrolytic
                  activities on crystalline or amorphous cellulose and xylan.
                  Specific isolates showed increased potential for growth in
                  lignin hydrolysates prepared from alkali pretreated
                  agricultural wastes. The results suggest that Keri isolates
                  represent a pool of effective lignocellulose degraders with
                  significant potential for industrial applications in a
                  lignocellulose biorefinery.},

                  characteristics of genes; (2) GO
                  annotations-evidence-supported statements asserting that a
                  specific gene product has a particular functional
                  characteristic; and (3) GO Causal Activity Models
                  (GO-CAMs)-mechanistic models of molecular âpathwaysâ (GO
                  biological processes) created by linking multiple GO
                  annotations using defined relations. Each of these components
                  is continually expanded, revised, and updated in response to
                  newly published discoveries and receives extensive QA checks,

                  relationships that extends the SCOP database. SCOP is a
                  manually curated ordering of domains from the majority of
                  proteins of known structure in a hierarchy according to
                  structural and evolutionary relationships. Development of the
                  SCOP 1.x series concluded with SCOP 1.75. The ASTRAL
                  compendium provides several databases and tools to aid in the
                  analysis of the protein structures classified in SCOP,
                  particularly through the use of their sequences. SCOPe extends
                  version 1.75 of the SCOP database, using automated curation
                  methods to classify many structures released since SCOP 1.75.
                  We have rigorously benchmarked our automated methods to ensure

                  many proteins to which our methods cannot be applied. SCOPe is
                  also partially manually curated to correct some errors in

                  ions. Here, we analyse the physicochemical properties,
                  chemical structures and functions of organic cofactors. Based
                  on a thorough analysis of the literature complemented by our
                  quantitative characterisation and classification, we found
                  that most of these molecules are constructed from nucleotide
                  and amino-acid-type building blocks, as well as some recurring
                  cofactor-specific chemical scaffolds. We show that, as
                  expected, organic cofactors are on average significantly more
                  polar and slightly larger than other metabolites in the cell,
                  yet they cover the full spectrum of physicochemical properties
                  found in the metabolome. Furthermore, we have identified
                  intrinsic groupings among the cofactors, based on their
                  molecular properties, structures and functions, that represent
                  a new way of considering cofactors. Although some classes of
                  cofactors, as defined by their physicochemical properties,
                  exhibit clear structural communalities, cofactors with similar
                  structures can have diverse functional and physicochemical
                  profiles. Finally, we show that the molecular functions of the
                  cofactors not only may duplicate reactions performed by
                  inorganic metal cofactors and amino acids, the cell's other
                  catalytic tools, but also provide novel chemistries for

                  them a wide range of microbial exposures, such as traditional
                  farms, are protected from childhood asthma and atopy. In
                  previous studies, markers of microbial exposure have been
                  inversely related to these conditions. METHODS: In two
                  cross-sectional studies, we compared children living on farms
                  with those in a reference group with respect to the prevalence
                  of asthma and atopy and to the diversity of microbial
                  exposure. In one studyâPARSIFAL (Prevention of Allergy-Risk
                  Factors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and
                  Anthroposophic Lifestyle)âsamples of mattress dust were
                  screened for bacterial DNA with the use of single-strand
                  conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses to detect
                  environmental bacteria that cannot be measured by means of
                  culture techniques. In the other studyâGABRIELA
                  (Multidisciplinary Study to Identify the Genetic and
                  Environmental Causes of Asthma in the European Community
                  [GABRIEL] Advanced Study)âsamples of settled dust from
                  children's rooms were evaluated for bacterial and fungal taxa
                  with the use of culture techniques. RESULTS: In both studies,
                  children who lived on farms had lower prevalences of asthma
                  and atopy and were exposed to a greater variety of
                  environmental microorganisms than the children in the
                  reference group. In turn, diversity of microbial exposure was
                  inversely related to the risk of asthma (odds ratio for
                  PARSIFAL, 0.62; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.89;
                  odds ratio for GABRIELA, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.75 to 0.99). In
                  addition, the presence of certain more circumscribed exposures
                  was also inversely related to the risk of asthma; this
                  included exposure to species in the fungal taxon eurotium
                  (adjusted odds ratio, 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.18 to 0.76) and to a
                  variety of bacterial species, including Listeria
                  monocytogenes, bacillus species, corynebacterium species, and
                  others (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.38 to 0.86).
                  CONCLUSIONS: Children living on farms were exposed to a wider
                  range of microbes than were children in the reference group,
                  and this exposure explains a substantial fraction of the
                  inverse relation between asthma and growing up on a farm.

                  wide array of different microorganisms living on surfaces and
                  in the air of our homes. Despite their ubiquity and abundance,
                  we have a limited understanding of the microbial diversity
                  found within homes and how the composition and diversity of
                  microbial communities change across different locations within
                  the home. Here we examined the diversity of bacterial
                  communities found in nine distinct locations within each of
                  forty homes in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, USA,
                  using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA
                  gene. We found that each of the sampled locations harbored
                  bacterial communities that were distinct from one another with
                  surfaces that are regularly cleaned typically harboring lower
                  levels of diversity than surfaces that are cleaned
                  infrequently. These location-specific differences in bacterial
                  communities could be directly related to usage patterns and
                  differences in the likely sources of bacteria dispersed onto
                  these locations. Finally, we examined whether the variability
                  across homes in bacterial diversity could be attributed to
                  outdoor environmental factors, indoor habitat structure, or
                  the occupants of the home. We found that the presence of dogs
                  had a significant effect on bacterial community composition in
                  multiple locations within homes as the homes occupied by dogs
                  harbored more diverse communities and higher relative
                  abundances of dog-associated bacterial taxa. Furthermore, we
                  found a significant correlation between the types of bacteria
                  deposited on surfaces outside the home and those found inside
                  the home, highlighting that microbes from outside the home can
                  have a direct effect on the microbial communities living on
                  surfaces within our homes. Together this work provides the
                  first comprehensive analysis of the microbial communities
                  found in the home and the factors that shape the structure of
                  these communities both within and between homes.}

                  thought. This article reviews literature related to DIET,
                  specifically in reference to anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic
                  granular sludge, a biofilm, is a specialized microenvironment
                  where syntrophic bacterial and archaeal organisms grow
                  together in close proximity. Exoelectrogenic bacteria
                  degrading organic substrates or intermediates need an electron
                  sink and electrotrophic methanogens represent perfect partners
                  to assimilate those electrons and produce methane. The granule
                  extracellular polymeric substances by making the biofilm

                  geographical features like rurality and climate with
                  microbiomes. It is essential to correctly integrate rich
                  geographical metadata; and inconsistent definitions of
                  rurality, can hinder cross-study comparisons. We address this
                  with OMEinfo, a tool for automated retrieval of consistent
                  geographical metadata from user-provided location data.
                  OMEinfo leverages open data sources such as the Global Human
                  Settlement Layer, and Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic
                  Carbon dioxide. OMEinfo's web-app enables users to visualize
                  and investigate the spatial distribution of metadata features.
                  OMEinfo promotes reproducibility and consistency in microbiome
                  metadata through a standardized metadata retrieval approach.
                  To demonstrate utility, OMEinfo is used to replicate the
                  results of a previous study linking population density to
                  bacterial diversity. As the field explores relationships
                  between microbiomes and geographical features, tools like
                  OMEinfo will prove vital in developing a robust, accurate, and
                  interconnected understanding of these interactions, whilst
                  having applicability beyond this field to any studies
                  utilizing location-based metadata. Finally, we release the
                  OMEinfo annotation dataset of 5.3 million OMEinfo annotated
                  samples from the ENA, for use in retrospective analyses of
                  sequencing samples, and suggest several ways researchers and
                  sequencing read repositories can improve the quality of
                  underlying metadata submitted to these public stores.

               samples. The bioinformatical analysis focuses on quality control

               operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a threshold of 97\%. The

               classification of species based on 16S rRNA sequence comparison.
               The distribution of reads and OTUs within and between samples can

                  introduced a methodological shift in how research teams
                  investigate microbial biodiversity, away from sequence
                  identity-based clustering (producing Operational Taxonomic
                  Units, OTUs) to denoising methods (producing amplicon sequence
                  variants, ASVs). While denoising methods have several inherent
                  properties that make them desirable compared to
                  clustering-based methods, questions remain as to the influence
                  that these pipelines have on the ecological patterns being
                  assessed, especially when compared to other methodological
                  choices made when processing data (e.g. rarefaction) and
                  computing diversity indices. We compared the respective
                  influences of two widely used methods, namely DADA2 (a
                  denoising method) vs. Mothur (a clustering method) on 16S rRNA
                  gene amplicon datasets (hypervariable region v4), and compared
                  such effects to the rarefaction of the community table and OTU
                  identity threshold (97\% vs. 99\%) on the ecological signals
                  detected. We used a dataset comprising freshwater invertebrate
                  (three Unionidae species) gut and environmental (sediment,
                  seston) communities sampled in six rivers in the southeastern
                  USA. We ranked the respective effects of each methodological
                  choice on alpha and beta diversity, and taxonomic composition.
                  The choice of the pipeline significantly influenced alpha and
                  beta diversities and changed the ecological signal detected,
                  especially on presence/absence indices such as the richness
                  index and unweighted Unifrac. Interestingly, the discrepancy
                  between OTU and ASV-based diversity metrics could be
                  attenuated by the use of rarefaction. The identification of
                  major classes and genera also revealed significant
                  discrepancies across pipelines. Compared to the pipeline's
                  effect, OTU threshold and rarefaction had a minimal impact on

                  system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life
                  support systems, cargo, and crew that are exposed to unique
                  selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, mandatory
                  microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft
                  and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture
                  methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be
                  cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the
                  true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS,
                  molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess
                  microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at
                  eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions
                  spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth. RESULTS:
                  The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 104
                  to 109 CFU/m2 depending on location and consisted of various
                  bacterial (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria) and
                  fungal (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota) phyla. Amplicon
                  sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the
                  culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar
                  numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load
                  (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across
                  locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time,
                  but not across locations, while fungal community remained the
                  same between samplings and locations. There were no
                  significant differences in community composition and richness
                  after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that
                  the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms.
                  Moreover, approximately 46\% of intact/viable bacteria and
                  40\% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured. CONCLUSIONS:
                  The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi
                  on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but
                  remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are
                  associated with the human microbiome and may include
                  opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first
                  comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria
                  and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be
                  used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA
                  requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of
                  this study can have significant impact on our understanding of
                  other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean
                  rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.},

                  established in 1987, has evolved into the main collection of
                  functional enzyme and metabolism data. In 2018, BRENDA was
                  selected as an ELIXIR Core Data Resource. BRENDA provides
                  reliable data, continuous curation and updates of classified
                  enzymes, and the integration of newly discovered enzymes. The
                  main part contains Â¿5 million data for â¼90 000 enzymes from
                  â¼13 000 organisms, manually extracted from â¼157 000 primary
                  literature references, combined with information of text and
                  data mining, data integration, and prediction algorithms.
                  Supplements comprise disease-related data, protein sequences,
                  3D structures, genome annotations, ligand information,
                  taxonomic, bibliographic, and kinetic data. BRENDA offers an
                  easy access to enzyme information from quick to advanced
                  searches, text- and structured-based queries for enzyme-ligand
                  interactions, word maps, and visualization of enzyme data. The
                  BRENDA Pathway Maps are completely revised and updated for an
                  enhanced interactive and intuitive usability. The new design
                  of the Enzyme Summary Page provides an improved access to each
                  individual enzyme. A new protein structure 3D viewer was
                  integrated. The prediction of the intracellular localization
                  of eukaryotic enzymes has been implemented. The new
                  EnzymeDetector combines BRENDA enzyme annotations with protein
                  and genome databases for the detection of eukaryotic and
                  prokaryotic enzymes.},

                  Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database. SCOP is an
                  expert-curated ordering of domains from the majority of
                  proteins of known structure in a hierarchy according to
                  structural and evolutionary relationships. SCOPe classifies
                  the majority of protein structures released since SCOP
                  development concluded in 2009, using a combination of manual
                  curation and highly precise automated tools, aiming to have
                  the same accuracy as fully hand-curated SCOP releases. SCOPe
                  also incorporates and updates the ASTRAL compendium, which
                  provides several databases and tools to aid in the analysis of
                  the sequences and structures of proteins classified in SCOPe.
                  SCOPe continues high-quality manual classification of new
                  superfamilies, a key feature of SCOP. Artifacts such as
                  expression tags are now separated into their own class, in
                  order to distinguish them from the homology-based annotations
                  in the remainder of the SCOPe hierarchy. SCOPe 2.06 contains
                  77,439 Protein Data Bank entries, double the 38,221 structures

                  âhypervariable regionsâ (V1-V9) that demonstrate considerable
                  sequence diversity among different bacteria. Species-specific
                  sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute
                  useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific
                  investigations. No single region can differentiate among all
                  bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the
                  relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic
                  goals are needed. We characterized V1-V8 in 110 different
                  bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens,
                  CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora.
                  Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable
                  regions V1-V8, and for selected combinations of regions or
                  short segments within individual hypervariable regions that
                  might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We
                  determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus
                  aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3
                  were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to
                  the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae.
                  V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterium species and V3 among
                  Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could
                  distinguish among most bacterial species except
                  enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to
                  differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including
                  Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single
                  polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for
                  genus or species-specific probes. The hypervariable
                  sequence-specific dendrograms and the âMEGALIGNâ files
                  provided online will be highly useful tools for designing
                  specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect
                  pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.}

                  taxonomic units (OTUs): clusters of sequencing reads that
                  differ by less than a fixed dissimilarity threshold. New
                  methods control errors sufficiently such that amplicon
                  sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the
                  level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene
                  region. The benefits of finer resolution are immediately
                  apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their
                  improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more
                  important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status
                  of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning
                  identified independently from a reference database. Here we
                  discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages
                  of closed-reference OTUs-including computational costs that
                  scale linearly with study size, simple merging between
                  independently processed data sets, and forward prediction-and
                  of de novo OTUs-including accurate measurement of diversity
                  and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in
                  reference databases. We argue that the improvements in
                  reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are
                  sufficiently great that ASVs should replace OTUs as the
                  standard unit of marker-gene analysis and reporting.}

                  by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), FMT has shown its
                  increasing effectiveness and safety in recent years for
                  recurrent CDI; moreover, it showed real clinical benefits in
                  treating SARS-CoV-2 and CDI co-infection. Crohn's disease and
                  ulcerative colitis are characterized by immune dysregulation,
                  resulting in digestive tract damage caused by immune
                  responses. Most current therapeutic strategies are associated
                  with high costs and many adverse effects by directly targeting
                  the immune response, so modifying the microbial environment by
                  FMT offers an alternative approach that could indirectly

                  resources of social and commercial value. It is carried out by

                  pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and agriculture as well as a
                  wide range of comparatively new ones such as aquaculture,
                  bioremediation, biomining, biomimetic engineering and
                  nanotechnology. The benefits of bioprospecting have emerged
                  from such a wide range of organisms and environments worldwide
                  that it is not possible to predict what species or habitats
                  will be critical to society, or industry, in the future. The
                  benefits include an unexpected variety of products that
                  include chemicals, genes, metabolic pathways, structures,
                  materials and behaviours. These may provide physical
                  blueprints or inspiration for new designs. Criticism aimed at
                  bioprospecting has been addressed, in part, by international
                  treaties and legal agreements aimed at stopping biopiracy and
                  many activities are now funded by agencies that require
                  capacity-building and economic benefits in host countries.
                  Thus, much contemporary bioprospecting has multiple goals,
                  including the conservation of biodiversity, the sustainable
                  management of natural resources and economic development.
                  Ecologists are involved in three vital ways: first, applying
                  ecological principles to the discovery of new resources. In
                  this context, natural history becomes a vast economic
                  database. Second, carrying out field studies, most of them
                  demographic, to help regulate the harvest of wild species.
                  Third, emphasizing the profound importance of millions of
                  mostly microscopic species to the global economy.}

                  domain classifications on the basis of structural data
                  available in the wwPDB. This procedure involves two steps;
                  firstly, we assign the binding of particular ligands to
                  particular domains; secondly, we compare the chemical
                  similarity of the PDB ligands to ligands in KEGG in order to
                  assign cognate ligands. We find that use of the Enzyme
                  Commission (EC) numbers is necessary to enable efficient and
                  accurate cognate ligand assignment. The PROCOGNATE database
                  currently has cognate ligand mapping for 3277 (4118) protein
                  structures and 351 (302) superfamilies, as described by the
                  CATH and (SCOP) databases, respectively. We find that just
                  under half of all ligands are only and always bound by a
                  single domain, with 16\% bound by more than one domain and the
                  remainder of the ligands showing a variety of binding modes.
                  This finding has implications for domain recombination and the
                  evolution of new protein functions. Domain architecture or
                  context is also found to affect substrate specificity of
                  particular domains, and we discuss example cases. The most
                  popular PDB ligands are all found to be generic components of
                  crystallisation buffers, highlighting the non-cognate ligand
                  problem inherent in the PDB. In contrast, the most popular
                  cognate ligands are all found to be universal cellular
                  currencies of reducing power and energy such as NADH, FADH2
                  and ATP, respectively, reflecting the fact that the vast
                  majority of enzymatic reactions utilise one of these popular
                  co-factors. These ligands all share a common adenine
                  ribonucleotide moiety, suggesting that many different domain
                  superfamilies have converged to bind this chemical framework.}

                  is now being understood as a type of digital object to which
                  FAIR should be applied. This emergence reflects a maturation
                  of the research community to better understand the crucial
                  role of FAIR research software in maximising research value.
                  The FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has
                  adapted the FAIR Guiding Principles to create the FAIR
                  Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). The

                  regions and what factors are most important in shaping the
                  types of microorganisms found inside homes. Here, we
                  investigated the fungal and bacterial communities found in
                  settled dust collected from inside and outside approximately
                  1200 homes located across the continental US, homes that
                  represent a broad range of home designs and span many climatic
                  zones. Indoor and outdoor dust samples harboured distinct
                  microbial communities, but these differences were larger for
                  bacteria than for fungi with most indoor fungi originating
                  outside the home. Indoor fungal communities and the
                  distribution of potential allergens varied predictably across
                  climate and geographical regions; where you live determines
                  what fungi live with you inside your home. By contrast,
                  bacterial communities in indoor dust were more strongly
                  influenced by the number and types of occupants living in the
                  homes. In particular, the female : male ratio and whether a
                  house had pets had a significant influence on the types of
                  bacteria found inside our homes highlighting that who you live

                  evolutionary relationships. SCOP2 was designed to provide a
                  more advanced framework for protein structure annotation and
                  classification. It defines a new approach to the
                  classification of proteins that is essentially different from
                  SCOP, but retains its best features. The SCOP2 classification
                  is described in terms of a directed acyclic graph in which
                  nodes form a complex network of many-to-many relationships and
                  are represented by a region of protein structure and sequence.

                  modelling the structure of proteins and their interactions,
                  enabling a huge range of applications in protein modelling and
                  design2-6. Here we describe our AlphaFold 3 model with a
                  substantially updated diffusion-based architecture that is
                  capable of predicting the joint structure of complexes
                  including proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions and
                  modified residues. The new AlphaFold model demonstrates
                  substantially improved accuracy over many previous specialized
                  tools: far greater accuracy for protein-ligand interactions
                  compared with state-of-the-art docking tools, much higher
                  accuracy for protein-nucleic acid interactions compared with
                  nucleic-acid-specific predictors and substantially higher
                  antibody-antigen prediction accuracy compared with
                  AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37,8. Together, these results show that
                  high-accuracy modelling across biomolecular space is possible
                  within a single unified deep-learning framework.}

                  different groups or obtained under different experimental
                  conditions using count sequence data is a challenging task due
                  to various issues such as inflated zero counts,
                  overdispersion, and non-normality. Several methods and
                  procedures based on counts, their transformation and
                  compositionality have been proposed in the literature to
                  detect differentially abundant species in datasets containing
                  hundreds to thousands of microbial species. Despite efforts to
                  address the large numbers of zeros present in microbiome
                  datasets, even after careful data preprocessing, the
                  performance of existing methods is impaired by the presence of
                  inflated zero counts and group-wise structured zeros (i.e. all
                  zero counts in a group). We propose and validate using
                  extensive simulations an approach combining two differential
                  abundance testing methods, namely DESeq2-ZINBWaVE and DESeq2,
                  to address the issues of zero-inflation and group-wise
                  structured zeros, respectively. This combined approach was
                  subsequently successfully applied to two plant microbiome
                  datasets that revealed a number of taxa as interesting
                  candidates for further experimental validation.}
