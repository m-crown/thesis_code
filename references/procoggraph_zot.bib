Rhea includes enzyme-catalyzed reactions (covering the IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature list), transport reactions and spontaneously occurring reactions. Rhea reactions are described using chemical species from the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology (ChEBI) and are stoichiometrically balanced for mass and charge. They are extensively manually curated with links to source literature and other public resources on metabolism including enzyme and pathway databases. This cross-referencing facilitates the mapping and reconciliation of common reactions and compounds between distinct resources, which is a common first step in the reconstruction of genome scale metabolic networks and models.},

This procedure involves two steps; firstly, we assign the binding of particular ligands to particular domains; secondly, we compare the chemical similarity of the PDB ligands to ligands in KEGG in order to assign cognate ligands. We find that use of the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers is necessary to enable efficient and accurate cognate ligand assignment. The PROCOGNATE database currently has cognate ligand mapping for 3277 (4118) protein structures and 351 (302) superfamilies, as described by the CATH and (SCOP) databases, respectively. We find that just under half of all ligands are only and always bound by a single domain, with 16\% bound by more than one domain and the remainder of the ligands showing a variety of binding modes. This finding has implications for domain recombination and the evolution of new protein functions. Domain architecture or context is also found to affect substrate specificity of particular domains, and we discuss example cases. The most popular PDB ligands are all found to be generic components of crystallisation buffers, highlighting the non-cognate ligand problem inherent in the PDB. In contrast, the most popular cognate ligands are all found to be universal cellular currencies of reducing power and energy such as NADH, FADH2 and ATP, respectively, reflecting the fact that the vast majority of enzymatic reactions utilise one of these popular co-factors. These ligands all share a common adenine ribonucleotide moiety, suggesting that many different domain superfamilies have converged to bind this chemical framework.},

  abstract = {Fluoride activation of G proteins requires the presence of aluminium or beryllium and it has been suggested that AIF4- acts as an analogue of the gamma-phosphate of GTP in the nucleotide site. We have investigated the action of AIF4- or of BeF3- on transducin (T), the G protein of the retinal rods, either indirectly through the activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase, or more directly through their effects on the conformation of transducin itself. In the presence of AIF4- or BeF3-, purified T alpha subunit of transducin activates purified cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) in the absence of photoactivated rhodopsin. Activation is totally reversed by elution of fluoride or partially reversed by addition of excess T beta gamma. Activation requires that GDP or a suitable analogue be bound to T alpha: T alpha-GDP and T alpha-GDP alpha S are activable by fluorides, but not T alpha-GDP beta S, nor T alpha that has released its nucleotide upon binding to photoexcited rhodopsin. Analysis of previous works on other G proteins and with other nucleotide analogues confirm that in all cases fluoride activation requires that a GDP unsubstituted at its beta phosphate be bound in T alpha. By contrast with alumino-fluoride complexes, which can adopt various coordination geometries, all beryllium fluoride complexes are tetracoordinated, with a Be-F bond length of 1.55 A, and strictly isomorphous to a phosphate group. Our study confirms that fluoride activation of transducin results from a reversible binding of the metal-fluoride complex in the nucleotide site of T alpha, next to the beta phosphate of GDP, as an analogue of the gamma phosphate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Here, we generate a historical account of the gradual discovery of primordial proteins, cofactors, and molecular functions using phylogenomic information in the sequence of 420 genomes. We focus on structural and functional annotations of the 54 most ancient protein domains. We show how primordial functions are linked to folded structures and how their interaction with cofactors expanded the functional repertoire. We also reveal protocell membranes played a crucial role in early protein evolution and show translation started with RNA and thioester cofactor-mediated aminoacylation. Our findings allow elaboration of an evolutionary model of early biochemistry that is firmly grounded in phylogenomic information and biochemical, biophysical, and structural knowledge. The model describes how primordial α-helical bundles stabilized membranes, how these were decorated by layered arrangements of β-sheets and α-helices, and how these arrangements became globular. Ancient forms of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) catalytic domains and ancient non-ribosomal protein synthetase (NRPS) modules gave rise to primordial protein synthesis and the ability to generate a code for specificity in their active sites. These structures diversified producing cofactor-binding molecular switches and barrel structures. Accretion of domains and molecules gave rise to modern aaRSs, NRPS, and ribosomal ensembles, first organized around novel emerging cofactors (tRNA and carrier proteins) and then more complex cofactor structures (rRNA). The model explains how the generation of protein structures acted as scaffold for nucleic acids and resulted in crystallization of modern translation.},

  abstract = {The lipid cubic phase or in meso method is a robust approach for crystallizing membrane proteins for structure determination. The uptake of the method is such that it is experiencing what can only be described as explosive growth. This timely, comprehensive and up-to-date review introduces the reader to the practice of in meso crystallogenesis, to the associated challenges and to their solutions. A model of how crystallization comes about mechanistically is presented for a more rational approach to crystallization. The possible involvement of the lamellar and inverted hexagonal phases in crystallogenesis and the application of the method to water-soluble, monotopic and lipid-anchored proteins are addressed. How to set up trials manually and automatically with a robot is introduced with reference to open-access online videos that provide a practical guide to all aspects of the method. These range from protein reconstitution to crystal harvesting from the hosting mesophase, which is noted for its viscosity and stickiness. The sponge phase, as an alternative medium in which to perform crystallization, is described. The compatibility of the method with additive lipids, detergents, precipitant-screen components and materials carried along with the protein such as denaturants and reducing agents is considered. The powerful host and additive lipid-screening strategies are described along with how samples that have low protein concentration and cell-free expressed protein can be used. Assaying the protein reconstituted in the bilayer of the cubic phase for function is an important element of quality control and is detailed. Host lipid design for crystallization at low temperatures and for large proteins and complexes is outlined. Experimental phasing by heavy-atom derivatization, soaking or co-crystallization is routine and the approaches that have been implemented to date are described. An overview and a breakdown by family and function of the close to 200 published structures that have been obtained using in meso-grown crystals are given. Recommendations for conducting the screening process to give a more productive outcome are summarized. The fact that the in meso method also works with soluble proteins should not be overlooked. Recent applications of the method for in situ serial crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers and synchrotrons are described. The review ends with a view to the future and to the bright prospects for the method, which continues to contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of some of nature's most valued proteinaceous robots.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular fingerprints are essential cheminformatics tools for virtual screening and mapping chemical space. Among the different types of fingerprints, substructure fingerprints perform best for small molecules such as drugs, while atom-pair fingerprints are preferable for large molecules such as peptides. However, no available fingerprint achieves good performance on both classes of molecules. RESULTS: Here we set out to design a new fingerprint suitable for both small and large molecules by combining substructure and atom-pair concepts. Our quest resulted in a new fingerprint called MinHashed atom-pair fingerprint up to a diameter of four bonds (MAP4). In this fingerprint the circular substructures with radii of r = 1 and r = 2 bonds around each atom in an atom-pair are written as two pairs of SMILES, each pair being combined with the topological distance separating the two central atoms. These so-called atom-pair molecular shingles are hashed, and the resulting set of hashes is MinHashed to form the MAP4 fingerprint. MAP4 significantly outperforms all other fingerprints on an extended benchmark that combines the Riniker and Landrum small molecule benchmark with a peptide benchmark recovering BLAST analogs from either scrambled or point mutation analogs. MAP4 furthermore produces well-organized chemical space tree-maps (TMAPs) for databases as diverse as DrugBank, ChEMBL, SwissProt and the Human Metabolome Database (HMBD), and differentiates between all metabolites in HMBD, over 70\% of which are indistinguishable from their nearest neighbor using substructure fingerprints. CONCLUSION: MAP4 is a new molecular fingerprint suitable for drugs, biomolecules, and the metabolome and can be adopted as a universal fingerprint to describe and search chemical space. The source code is available at https://github.com/reymond-group/map4 and interactive MAP4 similarity search tools and TMAPs for various databases are accessible at http://map-search.gdb.tools/ and http://tm.gdb.tools/map4/.},

The crystals have subsequently provided high-resolution structures by crystallographic means. It is possible that the hosting cubic phase created by monoolein alone, which itself is not a common membrane component, will limit the range of membrane proteins crystallizable by the in meso method. With a view to expanding the range of applicability of the method, we investigated by x-ray diffraction the degree to which the reference cubic-Pn3m phase formed by hydrated monoolein could be modified by other lipid types. These included phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin, lyso-PC, a polyethylene glycol-lipid, 2-monoolein, oleamide, and cholesterol. The results show that all nine lipids were accommodated in the cubic phase to some extent without altering phase identity. The positional isomer, 2-monoolein, was tolerated to the highest level. The least well tolerated were the anionic lipids, followed by lyso-PC. The others were accommodated to the extent of 20-25 mol \%. Beyond a certain concentration limit, the lipid additives either triggered one or a series of phase transitions or saturated the phase and separated out as crystals, as seen with oleamide and cholesterol. The series of phases observed and their order of appearance were consistent with expectations in terms of interfacial curvature changes. The changes in phase type and microstructure have been rationalized on the basis of lipid molecular shape, interfacial curvature, and chain packing energy. The data should prove useful in the rational design of cubic phase crystallization matrices with different lipid profiles that match the needs of a greater range of membrane proteins.},

  abstract = {For a number of years MDL products have exposed both 166 bit and 960 bit keysets based on 2D descriptors. These keysets were originally constructed and optimized for substructure searching. We report on improvements in the performance of MDL keysets which are reoptimized for use in molecular similarity. Classification performance for a test data set of 957 compounds was increased from 0.65 for the 166 bit keyset and 0.67 for the 960 bit keyset to 0.71 for a surprisal S/N pruned keyset containing 208 bits and 0.71 for a genetic algorithm optimized keyset containing 548 bits. We present an overview of the underlying technology supporting the definition of descriptors and the encoding of these descriptors into keysets. This technology allows definition of descriptors as combinations of atom properties, bond properties, and atomic neighborhoods at various topological separations as well as supporting a number of custom descriptors. These descriptors can then be used to set one or more bits in a keyset. We constructed various keysets and optimized their performance in clustering bioactive substances. Performance was measured using methodology developed by Briem and Lessel. “Directed pruning” was carried out by eliminating bits from the keysets on the basis of random selection, values of the surprisal of the bit, or values of the surprisal S/N ratio of the bit. The random pruning experiment highlighted the insensitivity of keyset performance for keyset lengths of more than 1000 bits. Contrary to initial expectations, pruning on the basis of the surprisal values of the various bits resulted in keysets which underperformed those resulting from random pruning. In contrast, pruning on the basis of the surprisal S/N ratio was found to yield keysets which performed better than those resulting from random pruning. We also explored the use of genetic algorithms in the selection of optimal keysets. Once more the performance was only a weak function of keyset size, and the optimizations failed to identify a single globally optimal keyset. Instead multiple, equally optimal keysets could be produced which had relatively low overlap of the descriptors they encoded.},

  abstract = {The apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a mitochondrial-flavoprotein that, after cell death induction, is distributed to the nucleus to mediate chromatinolysis. In mitochondria, AIF is present in a monomer-dimer equilibrium that after reduction by NADH gets displaced toward the dimer. The crystal structure of the human AIF (hAIF):NAD(H)-bound dimer revealed one FAD and, unexpectedly, two NAD(H) molecules per protomer. A 1:2 hAIF:NAD(H) binding stoichiometry was additionally confirmed in solution by using surface plasmon resonance. The here newly discovered NAD(H)-binding site includes residues mutated in human disorders, and accommodation of the coenzyme in it requires restructuring of a hAIF portion within the 509-560 apoptogenic segment. Disruption of interactions at the dimerization surface by production of the hAIF E413A/R422A/R430A mutant resulted in a nondimerizable variant considerably less efficiently stabilizing charge-transfer complexes upon coenzyme reduction than WT hAIF. These data reveal that the coenzyme-mediated monomer-dimer transition of hAIF modulates the conformation of its C-terminal proapoptotic domain, as well as its mechanism as reductase. These observations suggest that both the mitochondrial and apoptotic functions of hAIF are interconnected and coenzyme controlled: a key information in the understanding of the physiological role of AIF in the cellular life and death cycle.},

Based on a thorough analysis of the literature complemented by our quantitative characterisation and classification, we found that most of these molecules are constructed from nucleotide and amino-acid-type building blocks, as well as some recurring cofactor-specific chemical scaffolds. We show that, as expected, organic cofactors are on average significantly more polar and slightly larger than other metabolites in the cell, yet they cover the full spectrum of physicochemical properties found in the metabolome. Furthermore, we have identified intrinsic groupings among the cofactors, based on their molecular properties, structures and functions, that represent a new way of considering cofactors. Although some classes of cofactors, as defined by their physicochemical properties, exhibit clear structural communalities, cofactors with similar structures can have diverse functional and physicochemical profiles. Finally, we show that the molecular functions of the cofactors not only may duplicate reactions performed by inorganic metal cofactors and amino acids, the cell's other catalytic tools, but also provide novel chemistries for catalysis.},

Augmenting the training set of experimental structures with homology models allows us to significantly expand the number of predictable functions. DeepFRI has significant de-noising capability, with only a minor drop in performance when experimental structures are replaced by protein models. Class activation mapping allows function predictions at an unprecedented resolution, allowing site-specific annotations at the residue-level in an automated manner. We show the utility and high performance of our method by annotating structures from the PDB and SWISS-MODEL, making several new confident function predictions.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One method for rejuvenating land polluted with anthropogenic contaminants is through phytoremediation, the reclamation of land through the cultivation of specific crops. The capacity for phytoremediation crops, such as Salix spp., to tolerate and even flourish in contaminated soils relies on a highly complex and predominantly cryptic interacting community of microbial life. METHODS: Here, Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly were used to observe gene expression in washed Salix purpurea cv. 'Fish Creek' roots from trees pot grown in petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated or non-contaminated soil. All 189,849 assembled contigs were annotated without a priori assumption as to sequence origin and differential expression was assessed. RESULTS: The 839 contigs differentially expressed (DE) and annotated from S. purpurea revealed substantial increases in transcripts encoding abiotic stress response equipment, such as glutathione S-transferases, in roots of contaminated trees as well as the hallmarks of fungal interaction, such as SWEET2 (Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporter). A total of 8252 DE transcripts were fungal in origin, with contamination conditions resulting in a community shift from Ascomycota to Basidiomycota genera. In response to contamination, 1745 Basidiomycota transcripts increased in abundance (the majority uniquely expressed in contaminated soil) including major monosaccharide transporter MST1, primary cell wall and lamella CAZy enzymes, and an ectomycorrhiza-upregulated exo-β-1,3-glucanase (GH5). Additionally, 639 DE polycistronic transcripts from an uncharacterised Enterobacteriaceae species were uniformly in higher abundance in contamination conditions and comprised a wide spectrum of genes cryptic under laboratory conditions but considered putatively involved in eukaryotic interaction, biofilm formation and dioxygenase hydrocarbon degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal gene expression, representing the majority of contigs assembled, suggests out-competition of white rot Ascomycota genera (dominated by Pyronema), a sometimes ectomycorrhizal (ECM) Ascomycota (Tuber) and ECM Basidiomycota (Hebeloma) by a poorly characterised putative ECM Basidiomycota due to contamination. Root and fungal expression involved transcripts encoding carbohydrate/amino acid (C/N) dialogue whereas bacterial gene expression included the apparatus necessary for biofilm interaction and direct reduction of contamination stress, a potential bacterial currency for a role in tripartite mutualism. Unmistakable within the metatranscriptome is the degree to which the landscape of rhizospheric biology, particularly the important but predominantly uncharacterised fungal genetics, is yet to be discovered.},

Their light-harvesting complexes, called phycobilisomes (PBS), are composed of a conserved allophycocyanin core, from which radiates six to eight rods with variable phycobiliprotein and chromophore content. This variability allows Synechococcus cells to optimally exploit the wide variety of spectral niches existing in marine ecosystems. Seven distinct pigment types or subtypes have been identified so far in this taxon based on the phycobiliprotein composition and/or the proportion of the different chromophores in PBS rods. Most genes involved in their biosynthesis and regulation are located in a dedicated genomic region called the PBS rod region. Here, we examine the variability of gene content and organization of this genomic region in a large set of sequenced isolates and natural populations of Synechococcus representative of all known pigment types. All regions start with a tRNA-PheGAA and some possess mobile elements for DNA integration and site-specific recombination, suggesting that their genomic variability relies in part on a “tycheposon”-like mechanism. Comparison of the phylogenies obtained for PBS and core genes revealed that the evolutionary history of PBS rod genes differs from the core genome and is characterized by the co-existence of different alleles and frequent allelic exchange. We propose a scenario for the evolution of the different pigment types and highlight the importance of incomplete lineage sorting in maintaining a wide diversity of pigment types in different Synechococcus lineages despite multiple speciation events.},

Although the catalytic activities of many of these enzymes are somewhat predictable based on their amino acid sequences, the functions of their abundant ancillary modules are not and remain poorly studied. Here, we present the structural and functional analysis of a new family of ancillary carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), CBM51, which was previously annotated in data bases as the novel putative CBM domain. The high resolution crystal structures of two CBM51 members, GH95CBM51 and GH98CBM51, from a putative family 95 alpha-fucosidase and from a family 98 blood group A/B antigen-specific endo-beta-galactosidase, respectively, showed them to have highly similar beta-sandwich folds. However, GH95CBM51 was shown by glycan microarray screening, isothermal titration calorimetry, and x-ray crystallography to bind galactose residues, whereas the same analyses of GH98CBM51 revealed specificity for the blood group A/B antigens through non-conserved interactions. Overall, this work identifies a new family of CBMs with many members having apparent specificity for eukaryotic glycans, in keeping with the glycan-rich environment C. perfringens would experience in its host. However, a wider bioinformatic analysis of this CBM family also indicated a large number of members in non-pathogenic environmental bacteria, suggesting a role in the recognition of environmental glycans.},

We have found that none of the existing structural encoding schemata are capable of coping with the full complexity to be expected for experimentally derived structural carbohydrate sequence data across all taxonomic sources. This gap motivated us to define an encoding scheme for complex carbohydrates, named GlycoCT, to overcome the current limitations. This new format is based on a connection table approach, instead of a linear encoding scheme, to describe the carbohydrate sequences, with a controlled vocabulary to name monosaccharides, adopting IUPAC rules to generate a consistent, machine-readable nomenclature. The format uses a block concept to describe frequently occurring special features of carbohydrate sequences like repeating units. It exists in two variants, a condensed form and a more verbose XML syntax. Sorting rules assure the uniqueness of the condensed form, thus making it suitable as a direct primary key for database applications, which rely on unique identifiers. GlycoCT encompasses the capabilities of the heterogeneous landscape of digital encoding schemata in glycomics and is thus a step forward on the way to a unified and broadly accepted sequence format in glycobioinformatics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In higher multicellular eukaryotes, complex protein domain combinations contribute to various cellular functions such as regulation of intercellular or intracellular signaling and interactions. To elucidate the characteristics and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie such domain combinations, it is essential to examine the different types of domains and their combinations among different groups of eukaryotes. RESULTS: We observed a large number of group-specific domain combinations in animals, especially in vertebrates. Examples include animal-specific combinations in tyrosine phosphorylation systems and vertebrate-specific combinations in complement and coagulation cascades. These systems apparently underwent extensive evolution in the ancestors of these groups. In extant animals, especially in vertebrates, animal-specific domains have greater connectivity than do other domains on average, and contribute to the varying number of combinations in each animal subgroup. In other groups, the connectivities of older domains were greater on average. To observe the global behavior of domain combinations during evolution, we traced the changes in domain combinations among animals and fungi in a network analysis. Our results indicate that there is a correlation between the differences in domain combinations among different phylogenetic groups and different global behaviors. CONCLUSION: Rapid emergence of animal-specific domains was observed in animals, contributing to specific domain combinations and functional diversification, but no such trends were observed in other clades of eukaryotes. We therefore suggest that the strategy for achieving complex multicellular systems in animals differs from that of other eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) that are associated to disease can also be related with alterations in protein stability. Computational methods are available to predict the effect of single amino acid substitutions (SASs) on protein stability based on a single folded structure. However, the native state of a protein is not unique and it is better represented by the ensemble of its conformers in dynamic equilibrium. The maintenance of the ensemble is essential for protein function. In this work we investigated how protein conformational diversity can affect the discrimination of neutral and disease related SASs based on protein stability estimations. For this purpose, we used 119 proteins with 803 associated SASs, 60\% of which are disease related. Each protein was associated with its corresponding set of available conformers as found in the Protein Conformational Database (PCDB). Our dataset contains proteins with different extensions of conformational diversity summing up a total number of 1023 conformers. RESULTS: The existence of different conformers for a given protein introduces great variability in the estimation of the protein stability (ΔΔG) after a single amino acid substitution (SAS) as computed with FoldX. Indeed, in 35\% of our protein set at least one SAS can be described as stabilizing, destabilizing or neutral when a cutoff value of ±2 kcal/mol is adopted for discriminating neutral from perturbing SASs. However, when the ΔΔG variability among conformers is taken into account, the correlation among the perturbation of protein stability and the corresponding disease or neutral phenotype increases as compared with the same analysis on single protein structures. At the conformer level, we also found that the different conformers correlate in a different way to the corresponding phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the consideration of conformational diversity can improve the discrimination of neutral and disease related protein SASs based on the evaluation of the corresponding Gibbs free energy change.},

In computational chemistry or cheminformatics, molecules are typically represented by chemical descriptors, i.e., vectors that summarize information on its various properties. However, it is difficult to interpret these chemical descriptors since they are not directly linked to the terminology of functional groups or substructures that the biochemists use. METHODS: In this study, we used KEGG Chemical Function (KCF) format to computationally describe biochemical substructures in seven attributes that resemble biochemists' way of dealing with substructures. RESULTS: We established KCF-S (KCF-and-Substructures) format as an additional structural information of KCF. Applying KCF-S revealed the specific appearance of substructures from various datasets of molecules that describes the characteristics of the respective datasets. Structure-based clustering of molecules using KCF-S resulted the clusters in which molecular weights and structures were less diverse than those obtained by conventional chemical fingerprints. We further applied KCF-S to find the pairs of molecules that are possibly converted to each other in enzymatic reactions, and KCF-S clearly improved predictive performance than that presented previously. CONCLUSIONS: KCF-S defines biochemical substructures with keeping interpretability, suggesting the potential to apply more studies on chemical bioinformatics. KCF and KCF-S can be automatically converted from Molfile format, enabling to deal with molecules from any data sources.},

  abstract = {In an X-ray diffraction study using the method of multiple isomorphous replacement, the structure of aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2) complexed with the bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) has been solved to 2.5 A. Ten rounds of model building and 123 cycles of restrained reciprocal space refinement have resulted in a model containing 94.4\% of the theoretical atoms of the protein-inhibitor complex with an R-factor of 0.231. The fit of the model to the density is excellent, except for occasional side-chains and two sections of the regulatory chains that may be disordered. The electron density for the PALA molecule is readily identifiable for both catalytic (c) chains of the asymmetric unit and bonding interactions with several important residues including Ser52, Arg54, Thr55, Ser80, Lys84, Arg105, His134, Arg165, Arg229 and Gln231 are apparent. The carboxylate groups of the PALA molecule are in a nearly cis conformation. Gross quaternary changes between the T and R forms are noted and in agreement with earlier work from this laboratory. Namely, in the new structure the catalytic trimers move apart by 12 A along the 3-fold axis of the enzyme and relocate by 10 degrees relative to each other, adopting a more eclipsed position. The regulatory (r) chains in the new structure reorient about their 2-fold axis by 15 degrees. Large tertiary changes that include domain migration and rearrangement are also present between these two forms. In the R form both domains of the catalytic chain relocate closer to each other in order to bind to the inhibitor. The polar domain seems to bind primarily to the carbamoyl phosphate moiety of PALA, and the equatorial domain binds primarily to the L-aspartate moiety. Other changes in tertiary structure bring the 80s loop (from an adjacent catalytic chain) and the 240s loop into a position to interact with the PALA molecule. Changes have been searched for in all interface regions of the enzyme. While the C1-C4 and C1-R4 regions have been completely altered, most of the other interchain interfaces are similar in the T and R forms. The intrachain interfaces, between domains of the same catalytic chains, have undergone some reorganization as these domains move closer to each other when the inhibitor is bound. This new structure allows a reinterpretation of genetic and chemical modification studies done to date.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The presence of As in ground water, which is used for irrigation, is a matter of great concern since it affects crop productivity and contaminates food chain. In plants, As alters various metabolic pathways in cells including the interaction of substrates/enzymes with the sulfhydryl groups of proteins and the replacement of phosphate in ATP for energy. In addition, As stimulates the generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative stress. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) quench reactive molecules with the addition of glutathione (GSH) and protect the cell from oxidative damage. GSTs are a multigene family of isozymes, known to catalyze the conjugation of GSH to miscellany of electrophilic and hydrophobic substrates. GSTs have been reported to be associated with plant developmental processes and are responsive to multitude of stressors. In past, several studies suggested involvement of plant GST gene family in As response due to the requirement of sulfur and GSH in the detoxification of this toxic metalloid. This review provides updated information about the role of GSTs in abiotic and biotic stresses with an emphasis on As uptake, metabolism, and detoxification in plants. Further, the genetic manipulations that helped in enhancing the understanding of the function of GSTs in abiotic stress response and heavy metal detoxification has been reviewed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein domains are evolutionarily conserved building blocks for protein structure and function, which are conventionally identified based on protein sequence or structure similarity. Small molecule binding domains are of great importance for the recognition of small molecules in biological systems and drug development. Many small molecules, including drugs, have been increasingly identified to bind to multiple targets, leading to promiscuous interactions with protein domains. Thus, a large scale characterization of the protein domains and their associations with respect to small-molecule binding is of particular interest to system biology research, drug target identification, as well as drug repurposing. METHODS: We compiled a collection of 13,822 physical interactions of small molecules and protein domains derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Based on the chemical similarity of these small molecules, we characterized pairwise associations of the protein domains and further investigated their global associations from a network point of view. RESULTS: We found that protein domains, despite lack of similarity in sequence and structure, were comprehensively associated through binding the same or similar small-molecule ligands. Moreover, we identified modules in the domain network that consisted of closely related protein domains by sharing similar biochemical mechanisms, being involved in relevant biological pathways, or being regulated by the same cognate cofactors. CONCLUSIONS: A novel protein domain relationship was identified in the context of small-molecule binding, which is complementary to those identified by traditional sequence-based or structure-based approaches. The protein domain network constructed in the present study provides a novel perspective for chemogenomic study and network pharmacology, as well as target identification for drug repurposing.},

  abstract = {BigSMILES, a line notation for encapsulating the molecular structure of stochastic molecules such as polymers, was recently proposed as a compact and readable solution for writing macromolecules. While BigSMILES strings serve as useful identifiers for reconstructing the molecular connectivity for polymers, in general, BigSMILES allows the same polymer to be codified into multiple equally valid representations. Having a canonicalization scheme that eliminates the multiplicity would be very useful in reducing time-intensive tasks like structural comparison and molecular search into simple string-matching tasks. Motivated by this, in this work, two strategies for deriving canonical representations for linear polymers are proposed. In the first approach, a canonicalization scheme is proposed to standardize the expression of BigSMILES stochastic objects, thereby standardizing the expression of overall BigSMILES strings. In the second approach, an analogy between formal language theory and the molecular ensemble of polymer molecules is drawn. Linear polymers can be converted into regular languages, and the minimal deterministic finite automaton uniquely associated with each prescribed language is used as the basis for constructing the unique text identifier associated with each distinct polymer. Overall, this work presents algorithms to convert linear polymers into unique structure-based text identifiers. The derived identifiers can be readily applied in chemical information systems for polymers and other polymer informatics applications.},

  abstract = {Enzymes catalyze a particular reaction in cells, but only a few control the rate of this reaction and the metabolic pathway that follows. One specific mechanism for such enzymatic control of a metabolic pathway involves molecular feedback, whereby a metabolite further down the pathway acts at a unique site on the control enzyme to alter its activity allosterically. This regulation may be positive or negative (or both), depending upon the particular system. Another method of enzymatic control involves the cooperative binding of the substrate, which allows a large change in enzyme activity to emanate from only a small change in substrate concentration. Allosteric regulation and homotropic cooperativity are often known to involve significant conformational changes in the structure of the protein. Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) is the textbook example of an enzyme that regulates a metabolic pathway, namely, pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, by feedback control and by the cooperative binding of the substrate, L-aspartate. The catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of this enzyme have been extensively studied. A series of X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme in the presence and absence of substrates, products, and analogues have provided details, at the molecular level, of the conformational changes that the enzyme undergoes as it shifts between its low-activity, low-affinity form (T state) to its high-activity, high-affinity form (R state). These structural data provide insights into not only how this enzyme catalyzes the reaction between l-aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate, but also how the allosteric effectors modulate this activity. In this Account, we summarize studies on the structure of the enzyme and describe how these structural data provide insights into the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the enzyme. The ATCase-catalyzed reaction is regulated by nucleotide binding some 60 Å from the active site, inducing structural alterations that modulate catalytic activity. The delineation of the structure and function in this particular model system will help in understanding the molecular basis of cooperativity and allosteric regulation in other systems as well.},

Here, we have inferred an Earth microbial co-occurrence network from a communal catalog with 23,595 samples and 12,646 exact sequence variants from 14 environments in the Earth Microbiome Project dataset. RESULTS: This non-random scale-free Earth microbial co-occurrence network consisted of 8 taxonomy distinct modules linked with different environments, which featured environment specific microbial co-occurrence relationships. Different topological features of subnetworks inferred from datasets trimmed into uniform size indicate distinct co-occurrence patterns in the microbiomes of various environments. The high number of specialist edges highlights that environmental specific co-occurrence relationships are essential features across microbiomes. The microbiomes of various environments were clustered into two groups, which were mainly bridged by the microbiomes of plant and animal surface. Acidobacteria Gp2 and Nisaea were identified as hubs in most of subnetworks. Negative edges proportions ranged from 1.9\% in the soil subnetwork to 48.9\% the non-saline surface subnetwork, suggesting various environments experience distinct intensities of competition or niche differentiation. Video abstract CONCLUSION: This investigation highlights the interconnection patterns across microbiomes in various environments and emphasizes the importance of understanding co-occurrence feature of microbiomes from a network perspective.},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the datasets.}

By combining structural and sequence analysis, and phylogenetic inference, we have explored the evolutionary history of classes A, B, E, F, and G and demonstrate that their multidomain architectures reflect their phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that the main evolutionary steps in their divergence are likely to have arisen from the recruitment of different domains. Additionally, the functional divergence within in each class appears to have been the result of other mechanisms such as a complex set of single-point mutations. Our results reinforce the idea that a main constraint on the evolution of cofactor-dependent enzymes is the functional binding of the cofactor. Additionally, a remarkable feature of this family is that the sequence of the key flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding domain is split into at least two parts in all classes studied here. We propose a complex set of evolutionary events that gave rise to the origin of the different classes within this family.},

Unicellular eukaryotic diatoms are the main primary producers in this environment, where photosynthesis is limited by low concentrations of dissolved iron and large seasonal fluctuations in light, temperature and the extent of sea ice. How diatoms have adapted to this extreme environment is largely unknown. Here we present insights into the genome evolution of a cold-adapted diatom from the Southern Ocean, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, based on a comparison with temperate diatoms. We find that approximately 24.7 per cent of the diploid F. cylindrus genome consists of genetic loci with alleles that are highly divergent (15.1 megabases of the total genome size of 61.1 megabases). These divergent alleles were differentially expressed across environmental conditions, including darkness, low iron, freezing, elevated temperature and increased CO2. Alleles with the largest ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions also show the most pronounced condition-dependent expression, suggesting a correlation between diversifying selection and allelic differentiation. Divergent alleles may be involved in adaptation to environmental fluctuations in the Southern Ocean.},

Many transporters exhibit extremely high Gini coefficients even for common substrates, indicating considerable specialization consistent with divergent evolution. The expression profiles of SLC transporters in different cell lines behave similarly, although Gini coefficients for ABC transporters tend to be larger in cell lines than in tissues, implying selection. Transporter genes are significantly more heterogeneously expressed than the members of most non-transporter gene classes. Transcripts with the stablest expression have a low Gini index and often differ significantly from the “housekeeping” genes commonly used for normalization in transcriptomics/qPCR studies. PCBP1 has a low Gini coefficient, is reasonably expressed, and is an excellent novel reference gene. The approach, referred to as GeneGini, provides rapid and simple characterization of expression-profile distributions and improved normalization of genome-wide expression-profiling data.},

Understanding the mechanisms by which enzymes catalyse these reactions is essential in characterising the processes they regulate. Metal fluorides can be used as multifunctional tools for the study of these enzymes. These ionic species bear the same charge as phosphate and the transferring phosphoryl group and, in addition, allow the enzyme to be trapped in catalytically important states with spectroscopically sensitive atoms interacting directly with active site residues. The ionic nature of these phosphate surrogates also allows their removal and replacement with other analogues. Here, we describe the best practices to obtain these complexes, their use in NMR, X-ray crystallography, cryoEM and SAXS and describe a new metal fluoride, scandium tetrafluoride, which has significant anomalous signal with soft X-rays.Highlights⍰Enzymes that catalyse phosphoryl transfer are the largest family of enzymes and are involved in the storage and transmission of genetic information, energy transfer, signalling and cellular differentiation⍰Metal fluorides form a comprehensive tool kit to study the mechanisms of these enzymes by stabilizing the active conformation; mimicking both the transition state and ground state; and placing spectroscopically sensitive atoms into the active site⍰A guide is presented to the optimal formation of these complexes and their use in a wide variety of techniques in structural biology},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) is the major pathogen that causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). With the availability of large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) measurements, comparative network analysis can provide a promising way to study the host-virus interactions and their functional significance in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Until now, there have been a large number of HIV studies based on various animal models. In this paper, we present a novel framework for studying the host-HIV interactions through comparative network analysis across different species. RESULTS: Based on the proposed framework, we test our hypothesis that HIV-1 attacks essential biological pathways that are conserved across species. We selected the Homo sapiens and Mus musculus PPI networks with the largest coverage among the PPI networks that are available from public databases. By using a local network alignment algorithm based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), we first identified the pathways that are conserved in both networks. Next, we analyzed the HIV-1 susceptibility of these pathways, in comparison with random pathways in the human PPI network. Our analysis shows that the conserved pathways have a significantly higher probability of being intercepted by HIV-1. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis shows that most of the enriched GO terms are related to signal transduction, which has been conjectured to be one of the major mechanisms targeted by HIV-1 for the takeover of the host cell. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study clearly shows that the comparative analysis of PPI networks across different species can provide important insights into the host-HIV interactions and the detailed mechanisms of HIV-1. We expect that comparative multiple network analysis of various species that have different levels of susceptibility to similar lentiviruses may provide a very effective framework for generating novel, and experimentally verifiable hypotheses on the mechanisms of HIV-1. We believe that the proposed framework has the potential to expedite the elucidation of the important mechanisms of HIV-1, and ultimately, the discovery of novel anti-HIV drugs.},

DHFR was modified to permit the covalent addition of a fluorescent molecule, Alexa 488, and a biotin at the N terminus of the molecule. The fluorescent molecule was placed on a protein loop that closes over methotrexate when binding occurs, thus causing a quenching of the fluorescence. The biotin was used to attach the enzyme in an active form to a glass surface for single-molecule studies. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding of methotrexate to the enzyme is 9.5 nM. The stopped-flow studies revealed that methotrexate binds to two different conformations of the enzyme, and the association and dissociation rate constants were determined. The single-molecule investigation revealed a conformational change in the enzyme-methotrexate complex that was not observed in the stopped-flow studies. The ensemble averaged rate constants for this conformation change in both directions is about 2-4 s(-1) and is attributed to the opening and closing of the enzyme loop over the bound methotrexate. Thus the mechanism of methotrexate binding to DHFR involves multiple steps and protein conformational changes.},

In vivo, 5,10-meTHF is the main carrier of one-carbon (1C) units, which are utilized for nucleotide biosynthesis and other processes crucial for every living cell, but hyperactivated in overproliferating cells (e.g. cancer tissues). SHMTs are emerging as a promising target for development of new drugs because it appears possible to inhibit growth of cancer cells by cutting off the supply of 5,10-meTHF. Methotrexate (MTX) and pemetrexed (PTX) are two examples of antifolates that have cured many patients over the years but target different enzymes from the folate cycle (mainly dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase, respectively). Here we show crystal structures of MTX and PTX bound to plant SHMT isozymes from cytosol and mitochondria-human isozymes exist in the same subcellular compartments. We verify inhibition of the studied isozymes by a thorough kinetic analysis. We propose to further exploit antifolate scaffold in development of SHMT inhibitors because it seems likely that especially polyglutamylated PTX inhibits SHMTs in vivo.

Protein side chains change their states during dynamics, causing clashes that are propagated at distal sites. A convenient formalism to analyze protein dynamics is based on network theory using Protein Structure Networks (PSNs). Despite their broad applicability, few efforts have been devoted to benchmarking PSN methods and to provide the community with best practices. In many applications, it is convenient to use the centers of mass of the side chains as nodes. It becomes thus critical to evaluate the minimal distance cutoff between the centers of mass which will provide stable network properties. Moreover, when the PSN is derived from a structural ensemble collected by molecular dynamics (MD), the impact of the MD force field has to be evaluated. We selected a dataset of proteins with different fold and size and assessed the two fundamental properties of the PSN, i.e. hubs and connected components. We identified an optimal cutoff of 5 Å that is robust to changes in the force field and the proteins. Our study builds solid foundations for the harmonization and standardization of the PSN approach.},

I present here phylogenomic (135 proteins and two ribosomal RNAs), Bayesian relaxed molecular clock (18 proteins, SSU and LSU) and Bayesian stochastic character mapping analyses from 131 cyanobacteria genomes with the aim to unravel key evolutionary steps involved in the origin of marine planktonic cyanobacteria. While filamentous cell types evolved early on at around 2,600-2,300 Mya and likely dominated microbial mats in benthic environments for most of the Proterozoic (2,500-542 Mya), marine planktonic cyanobacteria evolved towards the end of the Proterozoic and early Phanerozoic. Crown groups of modern terrestrial and/or benthic coastal cyanobacteria appeared during the late Paleoproterozoic to early Mesoproterozoic. Decrease in cell diameter and loss of filamentous forms contributed to the evolution of unicellular planktonic lineages during the middle of the Mesoproterozoic (1,600-1,000 Mya) in freshwater environments. This study shows that marine planktonic cyanobacteria evolved from benthic marine and some diverged from freshwater ancestors during the Neoproterozoic (1,000-542 Mya).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical databases normally contain large amounts of data in a variety of forms. Although they grant significant insights into diagnosis and treatment, implementing data exploration into current medical databases is challenging since these are often based on a relational schema and cannot be used to easily extract information for cohort analysis and visualization. As a consequence, valuable information regarding cohort distribution or patient similarity may be missed. With the rapid advancement of biomedical technologies, new forms of data from methods such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or chromosome microarray (array CGH) are constantly being generated; hence it can be expected that the amount and complexity of medical data will rise and bring relational database systems to a limit. DESCRIPTION: We present Graph4Med, a web application that relies on a graph database obtained by transforming a relational database. Graph4Med provides a straightforward visualization and analysis of a selected patient cohort. Our use case is a database of pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Along routine patients' health records it also contains results of latest technologies such as NGS data. We developed a suitable graph data schema to convert the relational data into a graph data structure and store it in Neo4j. We used NeoDash to build a dashboard for querying and displaying patients' cohort analysis. This way our tool (1) quickly displays the overview of patients' cohort information such as distributions of gender, age, mutations (fusions), diagnosis; (2) provides mutation (fusion) based similarity search and display in a maneuverable graph; (3) generates an interactive graph of any selected patient and facilitates the identification of interesting patterns among patients. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a graph database for storing and querying medical databases. Our dashboard allows a fast and interactive analysis and visualization of complex medical data. It is especially useful for patients similarity search based on mutations (fusions), of which vast amounts of data have been generated by NGS in recent years. It can discover relationships and patterns in patients cohorts that are normally hard to grasp. Expanding Graph4Med to more medical databases will bring novel insights into diagnostic and research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In plants and photosynthetic bacteria, the tyrosine degradation pathway is crucial because homogentisate, a tyrosine degradation product, is a precursor for the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments, such as quinones or tocophenols. Homogentisate biosynthesis includes a decarboxylation step, a dioxygenation and a rearrangement of the pyruvate sidechain. This complex reaction is carried out by a single enzyme, the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), a non-heme iron dependent enzyme that is active as a homotetramer in bacteria and as a homodimer in plants. Moreover, in humans, a HPPD deficiency is found to be related to tyrosinemia, a rare hereditary disorder of tyrosine catabolism. RESULTS: We report here the crystal structure of Pseudomonas fluorescens HPPD refined to 2.4 A resolution (Rfree 27.6\%; R factor 21.9\%). The general topology of the protein comprises two barrel-shaped domains and is similar to the structures of Pseudomonas 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (DHBD) and Pseudomonas putida catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (MPC). Each structural domain contains two repeated betaalpha betabeta betaalpha modules. There is one non-heme iron atom per monomer liganded to the sidechains of His161, His240, Glu322 and one acetate molecule. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the HPPD structure and its superposition with the structures of DHBD and MPC highlight some important differences in the active sites of these enzymes. These comparisons also suggest that the pyruvate part of the HPPD substrate (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate) and the O2 molecule would occupy the three free coordination sites of the catalytic iron atom. This substrate-enzyme model will aid the design of new inhibitors of the homogentisate biosynthesis reaction.},

  abstract = {ChannelsDB 2.0 is an updated database providing structural information about the position, geometry and physicochemical properties of protein channels-tunnels and pores-within deposited biomacromolecular structures from PDB and AlphaFoldDB databases. The newly deposited information originated from several sources. Firstly, we included data calculated using a popular CAVER tool to complement the data obtained using original MOLE tool for detection and analysis of protein tunnels and pores. Secondly, we added tunnels starting from cofactors within the AlphaFill database to enlarge the scope of the database to protein models based on Uniprot. This has enlarged available channel annotations ∼4.6 times as of 1 September 2023. The database stores information about geometrical features, e.g. length and radius, and physico-chemical properties based on channel-lining amino acids. The stored data are interlinked with the available UniProt mutation annotation data. ChannelsDB 2.0 provides an excellent resource for deep analysis of the role of biomacromolecular tunnels and pores. The database is available free of charge: https://channelsdb2.biodata.ceitec.cz.},

They form diverse, complicated structures such as branched and cyclic forms. Web3 Unique Representation of Carbohydrate Structures (WURCS) was proposed as a new linear notation for uniquely representing glycans during the GlyTouCan project. WURCS defines rules for complex glycan structures that other text formats did not support, and so it is possible to represent a wide variety glycans. However, WURCS uses a complicated nomenclature, so it is not human-readable. Therefore, we aimed to support the interpretation of WURCS by converting WURCS to the most basic and widely used format IUPAC. RESULTS: In this study, we developed GlycanFormatConverter and succeeded in converting WURCS to the three kinds of IUPAC formats (IUPAC-Extended, IUPAC-Condensed and IUPAC-Short). Furthermore, we have implemented functionality to import IUPAC-Extended, KEGG Chemical Function (KCF) and LinearCode formats and to export WURCS. We have thoroughly tested our GlycanFormatConverter and were able to show that it was possible to convert all the glycans registered in the GlyTouCan repository, with exceptions owing only to the limitations of the original format. The source code for this conversion tool has been released as an open source tool. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/glycoinfo/GlycanFormatConverter.git.

We present a study of ligand-enzyme complexes that compares the similarity of bound and cognate ligands, enabling the best matches to be identified. We calculate the molecular similarity scores using a method called PARITY (proportion of atoms residing in identical topology), which can conveniently be combined to give a similarity score for all cognate reactants or products in the reaction. Thus, we generate a rank-ordered list of related PDB structures, according to the biological similarity of the ligands bound in the structures.},

The long time scale allows the observation of many spontaneous entries of PLQ into PSII, and the unbinding of plastoquinol (PLQol) from the complex. In addition to the two known channels, we observe a third channel for PLQ/PLQol diffusion between the thylakoid membrane and the PLQ binding sites. Our simulations point to a promiscuous diffusion mechanism in which all three channels function as entry and exit channels. The exchange cavity serves as a PLQ reservoir. Our simulations provide a direct view on the exchange of electron carriers, a key step of the photosynthesis machinery.},

The availability of entire genome sequences and of high-throughput capabilities to determine gene coexpression patterns has shifted the research focus from the study of single proteins or small complexes to that of the entire proteome. In this context, the search for reliable methods for assigning protein function is of primary importance. There are various approaches available for deducing the function of proteins of unknown function using information derived from sequence similarity or clustering patterns of co-regulated genes, phylogenetic profiles, protein-protein interactions (refs. 5-8 and Samanta, M.P. and Liang, S., unpublished data), and protein complexes. Here we propose the assignment of proteins to functional classes on the basis of their network of physical interactions as determined by minimizing the number of protein interactions among different functional categories. Function assignment is proteome-wide and is determined by the global connectivity pattern of the protein network. The approach results in multiple functional assignments, a consequence of the existence of multiple equivalent solutions. We apply the method to analyze the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein-protein interaction network. The robustness of the approach is tested in a system containing a high percentage of unclassified proteins and also in cases of deletion and insertion of specific protein interactions.},

Graph databases provide a great solution for this by storing data in a graph as nodes (vertices) that are connected by edges (links). The underlying graph structure can be used for the subsequent data analysis (graph learning). Graph learning consists of two parts: graph representation learning and graph analytics. Graph representation learning aims to reduce high-dimensional input graphs to low-dimensional representations. Then, graph analytics uses the obtained representations for analytical tasks like visualization, classification, link prediction and clustering which can be used to solve domain-specific problems. In this survey, we review current state-of-the-art graph database management systems, graph learning algorithms and a variety of graph applications in the clinical domain.

Algorithms used for this purpose include fragment-based fingerprint and graph-based maximum common substructure (MCS) methods. MCS approaches provide one of the most accurate similarity measures. However, their rigid matching policies limit them to the identification of perfect MCSs. To eliminate this restriction, we introduce a new mismatch tolerant search method for identifying flexible MCSs (FMCSs) containing a user-definable number of atom and/or bond mismatches. RESULTS: The fmcsR package provides an R interface, with the time-consuming steps of the FMCS algorithm implemented in C++. It includes utilities for pairwise compound comparisons, structure similarity searching, clustering and visualization of MCSs. In comparison with an existing MCS tool, fmcsR shows better time performance over a wide range of compound sizes. When mismatching of atoms or bonds is turned on, the compute times increase as expected, and the resulting FMCSs are often substantially larger than their strict MCS counterparts. Based on extensive virtual screening (VS) tests, the flexible matching feature enhances the enrichment of active structures at the top of MCS-based similarity search results. With respect to overall and early enrichment performance, FMCS outperforms most of the seven other VS methods considered in these tests.

Community-driven development of PDBx/mmCIF spans three decades, involving contributions from researchers, software and methods developers in structural sciences, data repository providers, scientific publishers, and professional societies. Having a semantically rich and extensible data framework for representing a wide range of structural biology experimental and computational results, combined with expertly curated 3D biostructure data sets in public repositories, accelerates the pace of scientific discovery. Herein, we describe the architecture of the PDBx/mmCIF data standard, tools used to maintain representations of the data standard, governance, and processes by which data content standards are extended, plus community tools/software libraries available for processing and checking the integrity of PDBx/mmCIF data. Use cases exemplify how the members of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank have used PDBx/mmCIF as the foundation for its pipeline for delivering Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data to many millions of users worldwide.},

  abstract = {We recently introduced the Gini coefficient (GC) for assessing the expression variation of a particular gene in a dataset, as a means of selecting improved reference genes over the cohort ('housekeeping genes') typically used for normalisation in expression profiling studies. Those genes (transcripts) that we determined to be useable as reference genes differed greatly from previous suggestions based on hypothesis-driven approaches. A limitation of this initial study is that a single (albeit large) dataset was employed for both tissues and cell lines. We here extend this analysis to encompass seven other large datasets. Although their absolute values differ a little, the Gini values and median expression levels of the various genes are well correlated with each other between the various cell line datasets, implying that our original choice of the more ubiquitously expressed low-Gini-coefficient genes was indeed sound. In tissues, the Gini values and median expression levels of genes showed a greater variation, with the GC of genes changing with the number and types of tissues in the data sets. In all data sets, regardless of whether this was derived from tissues or cell lines, we also show that the GC is a robust measure of gene expression stability. Using the GC as a measure of expression stability we illustrate its utility to find tissue- and cell line-optimised housekeeping genes without any prior bias, that again include only a small number of previously reported housekeeping genes. We also independently confirmed this experimentally using RT-qPCR with 40 candidate GC genes in a panel of 10 cell lines. These were termed the Gini Genes. In many cases, the variation in the expression levels of classical reference genes is really quite huge (e.g. 44 fold for GAPDH in one data set), suggesting that the cure (of using them as normalising genes) may in some cases be worse than the disease (of not doing so). We recommend the present data-driven approach for the selection of reference genes by using the easy-to-calculate and robust GC.},

  abstract = {With the progress of structural biology, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has witnessed rapid accumulation of experimentally solved protein structures. Since many structures are determined with purification and crystallization additives that are unrelated to a protein's in vivo function, it is nontrivial to identify the subset of protein-ligand interactions that are biologically relevant. We developed the BioLiP2 database (https://zhanggroup.org/BioLiP) to extract biologically relevant protein-ligand interactions from the PDB database. BioLiP2 assesses the functional relevance of the ligands by geometric rules and experimental literature validations. The ligand binding information is further enriched with other function annotations, including Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms, catalytic sites, and binding affinities collected from other databases and a manual literature survey. Compared to its predecessor BioLiP, BioLiP2 offers significantly greater coverage of nucleic acid-protein interactions, and interactions involving large complexes that are unavailable in PDB format. BioLiP2 also integrates cutting-edge structural alignment algorithms with state-of-the-art structure prediction techniques, which for the first time enables composite protein structure and sequence-based searching and significantly enhances the usefulness of the database in structure-based function annotations. With these new developments, BioLiP2 will continue to be an important and comprehensive database for docking, virtual screening, and structure-based protein function analyses.},

  abstract = {Amino acid catabolism is frequently executed in mitochondria; however, it is largely unknown how aberrant amino acid metabolism affects mitochondria. Here we report the requirement for mitochondrial saccharopine degradation in mitochondrial homeostasis and animal development. In Caenorhbditis elegans, mutations in the saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) domain of the bi-functional enzyme α-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase AASS-1 greatly elevate the lysine catabolic intermediate saccharopine, which causes mitochondrial damage by disrupting mitochondrial dynamics, leading to reduced adult animal growth. In mice, failure of mitochondrial saccharopine oxidation causes lethal mitochondrial damage in the liver, leading to postnatal developmental retardation and death. Importantly, genetic inactivation of genes that raise the mitochondrial saccharopine precursors lysine and α-ketoglutarate strongly suppresses SDH mutation-induced saccharopine accumulation and mitochondrial abnormalities in C. elegans Thus, adequate saccharopine catabolism is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis. Our study provides mechanistic and therapeutic insights for understanding and treating hyperlysinemia II (saccharopinuria), an aminoacidopathy with severe developmental defects.},
